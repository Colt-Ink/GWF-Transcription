1
00:00:00,987 --> 00:00:04,242
Whose fault was the wool panel? It's November and I want to wear my clothes.

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:07,957
We can't even see your bottoms. I looked at

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,477
the temperature. I knew it was going to be warm. Yeah, I think you,

4
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:14,127
like, complaining or something. I should have not worn

5
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:15,800
them. Yes. There we go.

6
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,352
Burn from our wound. Behind the scenes. This is who we are.

7
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,627
Yeah, this is behind the scenes. I just hate the heat.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,850
So god, too much.

9
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:39,517
What a fucker ty you doing? How you been? We're happy you're here.

10
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:43,197
Welcome to another episode of Guys We Fuck. It's the anti Slut Shame

11
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:46,617
podcast with a sweaty meatball over here. Because we're in camera

12
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:50,427
sweaty. I'm Christina Hudson. We can take you off camera. That'll solve

13
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,050
that.

14
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:59,532
Wow. We see people's true intentions. Shiny.

15
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:02,727
Oh, my God. My spicy meatball.

16
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:03,725
Oh, I've got.

17
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:09,807
That might be true. You can't let me know what makes it sad. I don't

18
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,650
think women are going to. Care that you said that. No. My God.

19
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:17,332
Anyway, welcome to the show. We're happy you're here. If you want

20
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:20,647
to email us, it's sorry about last night's show@gmail.com.

21
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:24,142
Today's subject line, I don't want to fuck my husband because

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,847
he will not shut up about not getting fucked. I have

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,102
been there hey. As old as time. Hey, ladies, I'll get

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,647
straight to it. My husband will not stop joking about how we weren't

25
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:38,032
going to have sex anyway. Oh, my God. Are you dating my ex

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,527
in response to everything I do? Oh, Jesus Christ. That's kind of

27
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:45,050
funny. I just had a baby four months ago.

28
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:49,522
Wow. Slow down, partner. Anyone who talked

29
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:52,662
about this on an expert level as far as babies

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,957
and stuff, they will say, expect not to have sex for a

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,647
year. Oh, really? Than a year? Yeah. I mean, also, too let the

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,147
person that just popped a baby out of their hooha fucking

33
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:06,472
rest if they want to. That's what I say. If you've been in a relationship

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,027
long enough, what's the difference? This should be all

35
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,542
that to you. My friend of comedy. Back in the stand up mike,

36
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:16,927
that's spiraling. What heat will do

37
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:20,707
to a man too high literal heat. I just had a baby four months ago

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,567
and it's been a rough journey, to say the least. With PPD

39
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:28,372
PPA trying to kill me, I have to work incredibly hard just

40
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:31,302
to keep from drowning. Oh, so much stress.

41
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:34,867
Yeah. No one wants to fuck under that. After an entire day of working

42
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:38,442
from home while also caring for the baby, I'm fucking spent.

43
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:42,427
Yeah, girl, I'm spent for you. He gets home and sees me pumping and

44
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:46,325
goes, wow, I haven't seen those in a while. Oh, I would kill him.

45
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,652
Show this to your husband. I would kill him. Fuck you, buddy.

46
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:53,812
I'm putting my middle finger up. Show this to him. Yes.

47
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,022
Brent taking his dick off. And that's me going, oh, fuck yourself.

48
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,472
Oh, actually, sorry. She'S now

49
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,997
mining a tinier dick. She gave him too much leeway. She pulled a real

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,327
maze, put him on a pedestal, crab after an entire day.

51
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,507
Okay, after work, pumping from home,

52
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:13,777
caring for the baby. I'm fucking spent. Yes, I'm pumping. And he says, Well,

53
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:17,547
I haven't seen those in a while. Or we'll make some other ogling comment.

54
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,692
God, he has no game. How did you have a baby in the first place?

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,792
That makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I cannot exist

56
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:28,927
around him without being sexual, and it makes me physically ill.

57
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:32,947
Although it may sound like I don't hate my

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,402
husband. Haha. Oh, my God. My sex

59
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:40,432
drive immediately say that for the court record. My sex drive

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,302
immediately dropped after I got pregnant, and I've been basically

61
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:47,977
been disgusted by sex ever since. All the comments on

62
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,457
top really solidify the grossness I feel.

63
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,117
When I talked to him about it, he said, quote, my brain is just

64
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,797
processing it like this. Even when I tell him that it hurts

65
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,187
me and it makes me not want to have sex.

66
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:06,267
The childbirth you didn't go through made you an asshole.

67
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,282
My brain is processing it like this, sarcastically.

68
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,967
Yeah. Without putting any physical labor into it for my body.

69
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,257
Are all men just so incredibly incompetent?

70
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:20,017
I'm going to say no, but my glass is always full. Girl. Does he not

71
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,947
care that he's hurting? Not helping. I'm reading the

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,642
book Come as You Are to try and tackle some of my processing about sex,

73
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,502
but so far I think I'm just fed up. I mean, I'm fed up with

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,562
them and I don't even fucking know him. I'm only 26,

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,252
so this is particularly everyone just cried a little bit. We all

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,300
got so sad. This had the weight of a 38 year old email.

77
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,767
Reds. Yeah. God damn. I'm only 26,

78
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:51,952
so this is particularly frustrating because I feel like I'm too young to already be

79
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,342
this miserable. I gotta be saying, you hate men a lot.

80
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,522
I don't blame you of it, but yeah, I went through this for how young

81
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,362
you are, and I know you don't hate your husband,

82
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:06,112
but we do. I'm also a bit late on the dumb bitch train.

83
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,832
By 25, I've already carried my husband to his dream job

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,732
while living in suburban Hill and starting a family just to realize I've completely

85
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,722
thrown myself away to achieve this. God, I hope your kid doesn't say this big

86
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,012
yikes. I do love being a mother. I'm getting so sad.

87
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,787
But it really sucks to realize everything I gave up without actually

88
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,907
being able to comprehend the decisions I was making while I

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,400
was young. This is why we do the work that we do.

90
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:35,947
We will. Girls, boys days and thems, everybody,

91
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:39,477
don't fucking get married and don't get married before 25. Just don't.

92
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,127
I would say the good news is, though, you already have a baby and like,

93
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:44,750
you're still so young that you still have so much.

94
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:49,447
Not that bad. Yeah, you're a young mom. That's pretty dope. I wanted

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,312
to mention this because I'm sure it has to do with my lack of interest,

96
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,647
but I'm not sure how to move forward. I don't want to hate my husband.

97
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,567
I really don't. But I don't know what to do at this point.

98
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:02,542
Thanks. PS. Love the special. Look, girl, not every

99
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,502
man is like this. And the fact he's your fucking partner.

100
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,827
He's your partner. He is raising this kid with you.

101
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,517
He needs to be utterly respectful of where

102
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:16,557
you are at sexually four months after you've

103
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:20,442
popped out a baby, whether it's through your vagina or through cesarean section.

104
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:24,777
And this motherfucker has makes remarks when you're breastfeeding,

105
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:28,327
when you're pumping. Tell them to go to hell. Don't tell them that, but tell

106
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,657
them I said it. That's so fucking inconsiderate. I think you can tell them to

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,907
go to hell. It's so fucking inconsiderate. That is so inconsiderate

108
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,612
of what your body has been through emotionally and physically

109
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:43,102
and mentally. That is insane to me. You're really going

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,947
to have to let him know that this is fucking serious, that he's not respecting

111
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:50,047
your boundaries and throwing these little one off lines of I guess we'll never

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,822
have sex. Are you fucking kiddingmate? You know what that does to a person?

113
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,987
It slowly chips away at you. What are you, my mom?

114
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,227
Don't you got to have a serious conversation about he needs to knock this the

115
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,850
fuck off and you're not fucking around. Also, like,

116
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:06,817
making a joke and like it

117
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:10,572
I'd honestly rather have someone be like, hey, you stupid bitch,

118
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:14,472
fuck me, then make a little side remark

119
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,797
about how they haven't seen my boogies. Like, it's so

120
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,697
immature. It's so immature. Also, it's fucking gross. That is not a man to me.

121
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,432
That is not sexy. He's acting like an immature boy. How could you want

122
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,907
to fuck him when he's acting like your son? Well, the fan is like,

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,597
they're so young. I'm guessing perhaps maybe they are like a similar

124
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:35,152
age, you know? Right. And like, he's a 25, 26 year

125
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,707
old man, but still, like, I've met 25 26 year old men

126
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:42,442
that can have respect for the fact that their fucking wife just gave

127
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,957
birth. But who do you know who's 25 I'm married? I was like, I don't

128
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:49,597
know about you. No, I was like, it's all

129
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,897
men that are not because the

130
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,292
comments this to me feels so 25 like, the comments because

131
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,177
it's like they're not you're going to just have to need some of the choice.

132
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:04,042
They're like, not in a place where they cannot take not getting

133
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,912
fucked, not personally.

134
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,400
And so probably not only enough to. Have a kid, but.

135
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:16,417
On their end. But yeah. He just does not understand the

136
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:19,722
complexity of your mental

137
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,325
health situation, your physical situation,

138
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:26,947
and you're really trying hard to meet him

139
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,382
in the middle and meet him where he's at, but I think he needs to

140
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,652
do some changing. Yeah, I think I don't know

141
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,902
the extent at which you've talked to him, but you have to have like a

142
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,762
very serious sit down conversation. This will not fly about postpartum,

143
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,772
about the physicality, about what childbirth is.

144
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:46,402
Get him some pamphlets, get him a book, get him some YouTube videos.

145
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,152
Also, he better. No, he better. There'll be

146
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,377
a quiz. Say there will be a quiz and give him a quiz in two

147
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:56,947
weeks. He also needs to understand, because he clearly doesn't because if the goal is

148
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,762
sex, he's not going about it in a way that is sexy.

149
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:04,267
Your body and mind not being ready aside, when the point comes

150
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:07,827
that you are ready to have sex again, he needs to understand that these fucking

151
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:11,107
one off remarks are so mature. That is the biggest fucking turn off.

152
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,300
It is the biggest fuck, oh my God, I'm turned off for you.

153
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,627
He has a four month old child. Spend time with your child. I'm sure there's,

154
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:21,875
I would guess, 1000 things to do around the house right now.

155
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,832
Yeah, it probably is. Yeah. I know it's hard, but I'm

156
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:29,857
not going to be like, leave him. No, it's not great for you. Yeah.

157
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,887
And if he's young right? Also if he's young, we're still malleable.

158
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:39,357
These are the things in a relationship that we got to communicate. It turns

159
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,112
you off when he does this and that's something that he needs to know.

160
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:45,727
And I think, sadly, age aside, this is a rather a

161
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,152
more common experience that women have than they would like. And obviously I'm

162
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:52,602
sure a lot of women don't talk about it because it's kind of like embarrassing.

163
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:56,202
And I just went through birth well, and also going back to the conversation

164
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:59,077
that we were having about the currency of boyfriend, or you can call it the

165
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:03,042
currency of husband, same thing. We oftentimes

166
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,287
make our as women, we make our heterosexual relationships

167
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:11,292
sound better to other women than they actually are because that increases

168
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:14,347
the value of the currency because we don't want to be embedded there.

169
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,037
We don't want to be embarrassed.

170
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,300
I think this is a really common experience.

171
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:28,452
We heard a similar email on Dan Savage at Five podcasts.

172
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:32,062
And I think just like, the reason why people aren't talking

173
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,722
about it is because it's embarrassing. Because we don't want other women to

174
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:39,777
know that we have a husband at home who's like, not completing

175
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:43,147
the fairy tale. And I think we finally did start

176
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,537
to talk about it. And that's why we all had this AHA moment

177
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,092
universally where we're like, wow. We were all sitting at home

178
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,602
silently unhappy, because we all thought that we

179
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,977
were all experiencing these relationships in the movies that we

180
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,482
see in the movies and it was only our husband or our boys, and that

181
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:03,192
was fucking up. And that's not true. And that's how men got away with murder,

182
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:06,667
both literal and metaphorical. Murder for

183
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,777
fucking years. Yep. It's not happening anymore.

184
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:13,102
Anymore. So we got to have conversations, because that's how people grow and change,

185
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:16,477
and that's how you can be closer to your husband. He needs

186
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:18,800
to understand what you need right now,

187
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:23,647
and it's not him. They have it in them. They have it

188
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,967
in them. Saying they don't is giving them another excuse.

189
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:30,502
Exactly. And I think this talking point of

190
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,297
men being incompetent they're not

191
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,602
you're not incompetent. They weren't incompetent. Secretary.

192
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:41,647
They weren't incompetent. They wanted to build an app. They weren't competent. They wanted

193
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,907
to put together their fucking Two K team challenge. Now it's

194
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:45,725
getting personal.

195
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:51,672
You gotta stop it. It wasn't

196
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:55,617
personal when you wanted to edit the video of you on your vacation.

197
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:58,372
But what I wanted to do is of our vacation. Okay, now it's getting really

198
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:02,122
personal. Two K is a basketball. Two K is a video game.

199
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,377
That was the thing where we walked by and there was a whole crowd at

200
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:08,502
Skin Fest, and you were like, what are they doing? Are they playing video games

201
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,902
like they're playing Two K because they haven't grown up? That was that.

202
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:16,325
Come on. It's a little easy. Shut up. All right, Michael, enough from you.

203
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:21,322
We don't want to hear from a man right now. We're a little sensitive to

204
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:24,547
your gender downfalls and

205
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,012
excuses, frankly.

206
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:31,117
Communication is key. Communication is key. It's the last thing

207
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,342
we end up we want to do for some reason. But I tell you,

208
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:38,272
you got to do it. You scrambled your DNA together. There's a human

209
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:41,767
being that exists that's half you have him. We gotta work this out, baby girl.

210
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,997
And just a men listening. Who if you want to have kids with a woman,

211
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,827
I mean, just fuck it. Don't try to know what you're getting into. Dick your

212
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:51,950
dick into that bloody gaping hole until it's healed. Unless you want it.

213
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:57,852
Maybe she wants it. Yeah, well, some women, when they're pregnant, their horny is fuck.

214
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,632
And they're like, I've never been to Horny. And then the guys like, oh,

215
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:03,052
my God. You know, it's pheromones and hormones and stuff. And then some

216
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,947
women are pregnant, they're like, don't even fucking look at me. And that's fine,

217
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,562
too. Everybody reacts to the surge of hormones and what's happening in their body completely

218
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,862
different. Literally creating a mini you.

219
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,107
Yeah. Respect that, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You don't

220
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,407
go what you want. Build a bear and mushroom stamp one of the guys who's

221
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:22,562
helping you stuff the arm. You could, but you get a rest. Be respectful.

222
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:26,182
Be respectful. So I don't dis someone the same as you. Don't go to

223
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,227
a restaurant and then call the waiter who's about to bring out your food a

224
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:32,975
stupid client because they're going to spin your food. That's true.

225
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,147
Thank you so much. Wow. Or just an food. Okay.

226
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,937
Yeah. I was like, that visuals only for if you watch it on Youtube.com.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,057
Yeah, we actually do special visuals for YouTube. So if you

228
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,672
want to see our hand gestures, you don't have to go to the YouTube version.

229
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:49,432
A lot of fake. Jacket off. Jacket off Youtube.com,

230
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,247
guys'bugs, without the you and fuck that's. Also, our social media handles Facebook,

231
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:57,262
Instagram, TikTok, Twitter. I'm at Christina Hutch. I'm at Philanthropy L.

232
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,772
Were you at Mike? I'm at Mike Cascarelli. Yay. You can also

233
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,622
see sometimes someone be talking, and then you can just tell them just, like,

234
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:07,117
processing of something really big in my head while they're going through it.

235
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:10,942
Yeah, so watch that on YouTube. That's fun. Just go,

236
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,987
what was I thinking of that in that moment? Yeah, very interesting.

237
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,332
Yeah. Sometimes I listen to the show and I

238
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,667
obviously forgot what I said, but then I'll respond in the same exact way

239
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,992
that I ended up doing it on a show, and I was like, wow,

240
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,847
you are very much yourselves. I'm jealous. It's like a hilarious game. I'm so

241
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
jealous of you.

242
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:34,797
Do you listen to the show and kind of know what you're going to respond

243
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:38,047
with? There was a period where I would listen to the show and get so

244
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,692
embarrassed because I kept interrupting everyone. And looking

245
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,752
back, I was like, the worst mental health period of my life. But I thought

246
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,375
it was the adderall. No,

247
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:51,667
it was like crazy anxiety and crazy, like,

248
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,875
just depression and me trying to be like, It's okay. All right.

249
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:58,972
That's what it was. Fueling it. And then I'm just like, oh, wow. I really

250
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:01,497
and then people emailed us about it, and I'm like, oh, I want to die.

251
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,177
I want to die. But you know what? I can only go up from here.

252
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,750
It turns out I can go lower.

253
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:11,375
Now you're finally understanding Mike and I'm religion over here,

254
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:16,412
nihilism limbo. Things can always be worse.

255
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,975
Oh, you're at rock bottom. Get a shovel up.

256
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,587
Challenge accepted. Gosh, baby.

257
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:28,267
Oh, my gosh. And also, you can find us and listen

258
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:32,727
to us at other places. You guys. I have a patreon where I release episodes

259
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:36,022
of my solo podcast of Voices in Our Heads. And I have

260
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,057
three to four times a month, I have Zoom Group

261
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:43,852
in quotes, chad Therapy. I'm not a licensed therapist, but I facilitate this

262
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,422
group therapy that I really fucking enjoy for an hour a couple of times

263
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,722
a month. So $5 a month will get you that, and that's pretty

264
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,722
cool. And also access to, like, all the weird classes I take.

265
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:56,542
I record audio and I upload it. Is that legal? I don't fucking know.

266
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,832
You know, I'm just fucked up. I doubt it. I paid for the fucking ticket.

267
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:03,202
I paid for the ticket, and now I want my patrons to enjoy it.

268
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,192
So patreon. Comcastinatchinson.

269
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:10,212
And then you can listen to without a country. It's my political podcast.

270
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:13,862
It is on YouTube. Without a country podcast,

271
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:17,932
we talk about the news. We talk about the most important news stories of the

272
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,877
week. It's mostly cover American news because we're doing it from the perspective of

273
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:25,287
the right and the left. But we also do a ted bit of international

274
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:28,417
we have a lot of Australian listeners, which I find to be very interesting,

275
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:31,977
and Canadian listeners. And we talk about animal rights

276
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:35,197
and we talk about pop culture. It's a great show. It kind of just like,

277
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,652
gives you a wrap up of what happened in the week so you can have

278
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,382
a conversation at the workplace and not seem like a fucking idiot. But you don't

279
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,527
have to, like, read all the news. Like, we kind of skim it and find

280
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,962
out the most important stuff for you. And we make jokes and it's fun.

281
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,597
So, yeah, listen to that. And it's also available in pure audio anywhere

282
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:55,562
you listen to podcasts, including Luminary, Apple, Spotify, all the places.

283
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:59,952
How are you? I'm good. We're just recording two interviews

284
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:02,347
at once. So we have to pretend that we had two weeks of life.

285
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,782
But I did store things on my phone. I scrolled across

286
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:09,382
an article. I have subscribed to Apple News. And I was like, I think this

287
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:12,307
is one of those articles where only two people said this, but they're trying to

288
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,532
make a headline to piss people off. But it was like Taylor Swift going on

289
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,242
tour in 2023. I want to move my wedding date. I'm like you fucking

290
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:21,997
what? Wow. What? Wow what?

291
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,282
Just go see her somewhere else. Yeah, but you

292
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:28,552
know, it's your prerogative. And you know what I do. I'm such a fan of,

293
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,750
like, having fun. But it's going to be hard to get.

294
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,437
I mean, I couldn't even get Lewis Capaldi tickets.

295
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:41,002
He sold out all his shows in like 2 seconds. And he's not as big

296
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,627
in the US. So he was only playing Radio City Musical here. I mean,

297
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,657
listen, I'll get it, but it's going to cost me a fucking fortune to get

298
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,307
the ticket off of StubHub or whatever. Does anyone have a CCA?

299
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:54,102
I don't know. He has like some fucking Scottish representation

300
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:57,082
or something. I should look it up. Does anybody work for Louis Capali? Can you

301
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:59,750
get current tickets? Give me a phone number.

302
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:05,622
Tell him I looked him up. Our compatibility on the pattern app. And the pattern

303
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:10,147
says me like it, uhoh if

304
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,052
he doesn't run from that, maybe they are meant to be. Oh, he's very weird.

305
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:18,172
Okay. He's very weird and I like

306
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,975
him a lot. Nice. How are you? Good.

307
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:25,822
Have you ever okay, so have you ever gotten into

308
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,450
your therapist head where you got your therapist to think more like you?

309
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:34,092
That's a you thing. It was a real win for me. My therapist,

310
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:37,327
my bestie, literally was telling me that she was in a session with

311
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:40,775
another client and then it was a man.

312
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:45,575
This could be bad. No.

313
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:49,775
And he was like, my life was over.

314
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,527
And she started she started thinking of me and

315
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,797
all, like, these feminist ideals. That I pumped into her head.

316
00:18:56,905 --> 00:19:00,425
Nice. And she was like, man, I really wish that Corinne was here.

317
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:05,407
And then she was like and she was like she

318
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,647
had the feminist response that I would agree with,

319
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,747
which was like, how about you, like, self sued for five fucking

320
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,177
seconds? But she was like, that. I had to get out of that mindset because

321
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:20,077
I needed to help him from where he was at and his

322
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:23,737
relationship with his female partner, because he basically

323
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,142
wasn't getting enough attention. And I was like, oh, wow. I love

324
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,427
everything that I'm hearing right now. I hate that. That's a problem. I feel like

325
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:34,267
I got too much into her head. And also another

326
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,507
proud of that. I think she thinks too highly of me.

327
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,972
So then she'll think, like, I'll give her scenarios and

328
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,777
she'll definitely things are. Going to work out. And I'm like, I honestly don't think

329
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:47,752
they are. I think you just think I'm so awesome.

330
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,825
Wow. Literally, at one point,

331
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,237
she said to me things like, she's not you. And I go,

332
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,182
Are we? I said, but are we in love? But are we in

333
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:02,197
love? Wow. And I go. I go.

334
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:05,527
Do I agree with you? Obviously. But is that the

335
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:08,677
way that the world actually works and functions in this advice going to

336
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:10,850
help me? I don't know what it is,

337
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:19,422
but. Does she help you in therapy? Honestly,

338
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,917
I'm just there to complain for an hour so that I don't have to complain

339
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:26,802
to someone I know in real life. Right. That's really all therapy

340
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:29,127
is for me. Yeah. No guiltfree.

341
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:32,392
Complaining every now and then. Every man should try it.

342
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,052
She'll recommend, like, a book or give

343
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,292
me a little line or something. That's helpful. But most of all,

344
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,802
it's just me airing my grievances, which make me have better relationships with the people

345
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,347
around me because I don't hold in the resentment. That's great. And then it's

346
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:49,475
like, let the air. Other than that,

347
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:54,352
it's like me working out a bit by talking it out at an open mic.

348
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:57,772
Ultimately, I'm coming to the conclusion by myself. We have very

349
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:01,092
different therapy sessions. And then sometimes, obviously, with things like, OCD,

350
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:04,927
she introduced me to tapping and stuff, which actually is very helpful. I'm like,

351
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:08,842
we'll meditate a little bit. You know, that kind of stuff is good. But yeah,

352
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,367
no, overall, she'll be like, you're great.

353
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:15,142
You're good enough. And I'm like, that was never an issue. What are we talking

354
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,997
about right now at SoulCycle in the Hamptons? Yes.

355
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,325
She'll be like, you are safe. I know. I'm in my house. I'm fine.

356
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:26,075
I don't need these kind of thought. Like things to say.

357
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:30,412
There'll be a quiet moment. And she'll be like, are you afraid that

358
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,267
everyone you love will leave you? And I go, no, obviously not.

359
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:38,122
Like, what? Just funny to me. I go, yeah, I never

360
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:40,550
even crossed my mind until you just brought it up right now.

361
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,942
It just makes me laugh. That's great. It's such an interesting insight

362
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:49,662
though. A therapist's response to me is such interesting insight

363
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:53,002
into what other people are going through. Because I

364
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,792
know, obviously it's a numbers game.

365
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,452
She's giving me the answer that's most likely to soothe me.

366
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,525
No one is an expert in anybody else, you know? Right.

367
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:06,892
And so when she gives me these answers and I'm sure soothing to many

368
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,912
other people, they're not. I'm like, wow, everyone's real fucked up.

369
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:14,347
Yeah, that's true. And they are real fucked up. And they are. Every day is

370
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,677
a struggle. I'm just like, that's just not and.

371
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:20,122
Then I'll just like, get off this zoom and I'll be like, well, at least

372
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,657
I'm not those other people that those responsible for.

373
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,572
True. So therapy didn't work in

374
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:30,712
the way that it was intended to, but it still worked, you know?

375
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,552
Gotta love therapy. It's funny to me. You know what's funny to me?

376
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,925
These guys, the interview you're about to fucking hear. Oh, my God,

377
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:42,322
you guys. Cran and I, we went to Skate Fest Las Vegas and

378
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,492
it was everything we thought it would be more. It was fucking fantastic.

379
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:48,447
I lost a lot of virginities. No. Whole virginia.

380
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,952
I was like, what? Aid Virginia and crowd surfing Virginia at the exact same

381
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,002
time? It was great. I feel like I had a laugh gasm.

382
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:58,117
It was awesome. But one of the other awesome things was the

383
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:01,582
live recordings of guys we fucked were fucking fire.

384
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:05,452
Okay, we're really excited to present you this first one. Ladies and

385
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,517
gentlemen, please welcome to the show karen Fehan

386
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:10,412
and Chloe LeBranche.

387
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:18,972
Hello. What an outfit. Karen sexy.

388
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:21,800
Thank you so much. Hello.

389
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:27,447
I was flipping. Hello. All right, take a seat.

390
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:30,847
Take a seat. Do you guys have any thoughts on the selection of

391
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,587
men that we've seen so far tonight? Could you tell? The wet spot

392
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:37,025
for my parents suffering back here.

393
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:40,787
And while you weren't a match so you could breathe.

394
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,050
Common buckets in my fish net.

395
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:50,182
Clean up and I don't care. Is it like, hard for you to.

396
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:53,032
Get wet or you get wet very quickly? I'm a real wet bitch. Yeah,

397
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,032
like all the time wet or something has to happen. Yeah. If you want to

398
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,862
feel it right now. Christina, I wish I was kidding.

399
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:03,212
What made you wet? It's not really a hot outfit.

400
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:09,277
I thought she was like, I love sunship. So that vending machine story just

401
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,687
really got me offending.

402
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:15,662
I didn't really come to the poor youth.

403
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:20,150
Well, this festival has plenty of that. Okay.

404
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:24,552
Chloe, are you what? I'm all dried

405
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:25,175
up.

406
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:30,287
Always wet in her brain.

407
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:37,250
Karen's wet in her mouth. I'm sucking all the dick today.

408
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:46,722
Can I say something about the rape stuff? Yeah, please. Not rape

409
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,500
if you have a job and.

410
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,250
No men. Listen, to that.

411
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:58,147
If you have a job. Yeah, I've been thinking that for years. Okay,

412
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,312
there's a guy in here who's, like, maybe that vending machine guy is hiring.

413
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:06,950
Carrying a blow job.

414
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:11,872
When was the last time you gave a blowjob? You like that?

415
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,992
Oh, my God. All day today. Wait,

416
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,312
wait. I think she got so many spots.

417
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:23,922
Chloe came here booked on one show. She's headlining

418
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:29,127
all day, guys. I mean, my office is in my. Mouth, so I'm

419
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:32,377
headlining back at the. Hotel, and there

420
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:36,662
is no HR, just age rape.

421
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,182
Okay, so Karen and I were talking about this before we started.

422
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,467
How many guys we go down the line. How many guys at this festival have

423
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:47,842
you each fucked? Me? Have I

424
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,975
fucked? Yeah. Zero. Wait,

425
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:54,967
we're not talking about, like, this weekend. So,

426
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:59,122
in the totality of your comedy court, no one here that you fucked? They're not

427
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,112
physically here, but they're on the roster.

428
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,572
They didn't show up because they knew I was coming. You scared

429
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:11,617
them. Got it. I mean, would I fuck a certain guy here?

430
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,675
Yeah. Well, yes. All right.

431
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,612
Does his name rhyme with pain? Lilith?

432
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,887
No, it rhymes with Danish.

433
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:30,277
Now. Yeah. I didn't know. How? Common knowledge is

434
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:34,042
Ryan Rayner how much Chloe wants

435
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,512
to fuck Gilly.

436
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:39,725
Oh, and keep don't forget about that,

437
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:44,152
too. I got three holes. Who's coming for the

438
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,850
next? Oh, yeah.

439
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:50,817
I got three. Wow. This has all been a joke.

440
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:52,700
Sign an NDA, please.

441
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:58,932
My puzzle is a fortress, and I'll

442
00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:02,377
trap you in it'd. Only be what

443
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:04,412
is it when someone goes into your fortress?

444
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:08,375
Invaders. Rape. Yeah,

445
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:14,762
unless there's a job and their. Name rhymes with Philly.

446
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:19,062
What? Syphilis.

447
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:19,775
Okay.

448
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:25,822
You'Re probably here. Karen, how many guys have you

449
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:29,127
here? I don't know. Probably, like, a baker's

450
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:33,597
does or something. Wow. Really? What about weekend

451
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:35,750
two? Week two?

452
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:40,787
Yeah. I can't even think of Eddie. Oh, I can think of wine.

453
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:44,392
We flew in the porn star. No, I know that. When I thought of him,

454
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,507
the other one that I was like, I want. To have sex with you so

455
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,117
that. I can forget about this other guy that I really like. But you're also

456
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,342
cute, but I'm like. I don't know who that is. Okay, sorry.

457
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:56,157
Can you tell me, too? Oh, right. I forgot. You it's

458
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:58,925
here. Okay. Jim Norton. Oh.

459
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:06,512
Yeah. That guy could easily rape because he's a fighter.

460
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:11,157
Oh, the guy I whisker not Jim. Not Jim Norton. It's not a fighter.

461
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:14,902
Chim Norton will lay down and let me take it. Love that

462
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,357
man. Corinne. I'm sorry. I'm counting.

463
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:22,057
I keep forgetting. Okay. I wish I was more

464
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,097
of a slut analyt.

465
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:28,850
Wait, I got to redo mine. Okay,

466
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:33,812
mine is four, but three are comic. One's, not a comic.

467
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:41,467
And I also had one who it would be fine

468
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:45,287
if one person who was on the roster showed up. They're on your roster.

469
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:49,625
It benefits to figure out which one. Of the lucky volunteers, it was

470
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:54,102
blind Mike. Only so he can't

471
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,472
meet who you. Wait, there's a blind guy here? Yeah, he works here. He's part

472
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,982
of the guest digital team. Yeah, surprisingly, it's my dream to date a

473
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:05,037
blind guy. No. I knew that my choices in dating had gotten too sloppy

474
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:08,932
when I walked into gas digital one day and Blind Mike screamed at me,

475
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,457
she's mine. And I was like, I've been fucking too low on

476
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,547
the totem pole for quite some time. You want to date a blind guy?

477
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,562
Is that because they're good with their hands? Possibly.

478
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:23,652
It's just because I don't have to look. Yeah, you never have to wear makeup.

479
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:27,022
I don't think care about how I look. What a relaxing lifestyle that sounds

480
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:30,217
like. This is how blind people shake hands. That's okay.

481
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,677
You can touch my face. That's fine. Yeah. If you're blind, you could touch my

482
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:35,000
face. If you're blind and we're fucking, you could touch my face.

483
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:40,112
Has any one of these people ever fucked anyone with a disability?

484
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,602
Just Lewis. He's got

485
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,397
a couple. He has

486
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,787
Ad, Dhpv.

487
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:56,075
How is Louis in bed? Great.

488
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:02,242
You, like, hate fucking? Like, I mean, it always

489
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,452
feels that way when someone's sweating on you and talking about their mom under their

490
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,062
breath.

491
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:10,937
I'm kidding.

492
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:21,350
On my head. It's playing on my head. Sorry.

493
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:25,467
Just went all over you. Oh, my God. This stuff was so uncomfortable.

494
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,897
Okay. I haven't you

495
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,612
haven't what? The guy with a disability. Oh,

496
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,927
you should. But I wouldn't fuck a guy in a wheelchair because he couldn't get

497
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:38,037
away from me. You're mine forever.

498
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:41,952
Try to roll away. That's your horror

499
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,762
movie. You're just fucking collecting.

500
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:47,837
You don't have to leave. I got a closet of legs.

501
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:53,797
You're like Jeffrey Dahmer, but, like, waist down. Yeah,

502
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:56,687
except for I don't recycle because I don't eat the bodies.

503
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,187
You calling me fat, you bitch.

504
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:09,125
Yeah, let's give her Chloe fat. She won't make it to next game.

505
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:18,967
No one calls fat. Oh, my God. I don't think anyone

506
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:22,462
on stage besides me has actually been called fat. So keep doing it.

507
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:26,427
I like it. Or I called a hot retard yesterday.

508
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:29,847
Yeah. Someone goes, I didn't know autistic

509
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:33,427
girls could be hot. That's how they brought me up

510
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:37,197
on stage. Wow, a comics.

511
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:40,175
That better, because I didn't know his name. Yeah,

512
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:44,167
well, I brought him up and I introduced him, and I didn't know his name.

513
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:47,302
And then after, he just started calling me a hot retard, and I was like,

514
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,842
I'll fucking take it. Yeah. Because I blacked out. It up to the hot

515
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,900
compliment, right? Yeah.

516
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,137
There was a cleanup and aisle Chloe.

517
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:06,772
She made a mess. All right. This is

518
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:08,900
beautiful. She makes a mess. Okay.

519
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:12,275
All right. So I think it's like a grocery store.

520
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:17,397
We got the aisle reference at the grocery

521
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:20,292
store. We got it. We didn't think it was, like, an island in your apartment.

522
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:24,982
We got it. Sorry. I'm just used to my jokes not hitting friends.

523
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,267
Yeah, that's why I can't play blackjack here.

524
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,725
To remind you of my ex used to hit me.

525
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,450
Oh, come on, you guys. She deserved it. Look at her. Yeah.

526
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,375
Did you look at them just like that?

527
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:42,927
Sorry. No, I did deserve

528
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:46,175
it because there's a lot been a lot of cleanups in that house.

529
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:52,175
I get so wet and when a guy hits me

530
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:56,525
let's do a segment. I know everyone's powering. Yeah.

531
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,225
I'm really sorry about that.

532
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:07,567
But you got hit and you liked it. Hey, you like what you like?

533
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:11,472
Sometimes I accidentally masturbated after watching Woodstock

534
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:14,977
99 documentary. Sometimes we get off to

535
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:18,577
things that we don't like and someone else masturbated to that

536
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:21,212
documentary. When it's a guy, I'm not as impressed.

537
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:25,002
What's the weirdest thing you've ever masturbated to, Karen?

538
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:27,275
Why'd? You be so dead of the eyes.

539
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:32,677
Oh, God. You're probably just like a toxic ex or

540
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:36,057
something. Nothing that crazy. Oh, you know what? I used to have this reoccurring dream

541
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:39,477
that Lindsay Lohan beat me with a fresh fruit

542
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:43,632
platter and that got me kind of horny. She got big titties.

543
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,175
She does. She has her in.

544
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:50,827
They were in. It was the beating that I went because

545
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,782
she dated an ex boyfriend of mine. So I thought it was hot that she

546
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:56,877
was so angry. Have you ever masturbated anything weird, Karen?

547
00:33:56,982 --> 00:34:00,950
Oh, yeah. Just like the kitty stuff. You're not supposed to say.

548
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,975
The kids stuff. No,

549
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:10,147
I just like really old guys. How old?

550
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:13,747
Like, you guys are the blue pill, man. Fuck you,

551
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,257
nerds. Oh, you mean the guys. You need

552
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,750
guys that are like gangbang, like a cheerleader or whatever? Yeah.

553
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,262
Like what? Like 75 at odds.

554
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:30,275
Might need a pacemaker change, right?

555
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,775
Yes. It's kind of hot. Will you die? I do that.

556
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:38,707
Any doctor exam? Porn? Yeah.

557
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,825
Have you parked a guy that old in real life? No.

558
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,657
How old did you go? I mean, going young, late, it's how my fault they're

559
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:49,552
like me. Yeah. When I was like

560
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,217
20, I fucked like a 33 year old for a while. This like, Israeli mob

561
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:53,900
guy.

562
00:34:56,737 --> 00:34:59,750
Sorry. What's the oldest you fuck? 39.

563
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:03,262
How old were you at the time? 32.

564
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,547
That's not bad. And he was my boyfriend. I think if you said ten,

565
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,957
it would be really sold it. But I did recently fucked

566
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:13,262
a 25 year old guy. Named his name Jacob.

567
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,900
Jacob. Money mo problem.

568
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:23,052
What happened to Jacquemo? I was hearing about him alder in Cobet.

569
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:24,962
He moved back to Milano.

570
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:32,900
All right, but first before he moved to Milano, he was like, no.

571
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:36,877
So he dumped you and then he moved to Milan. But you like to say

572
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:40,132
that it ended because he moved back to Milan. He couldn't handle my trauma in

573
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:44,087
the bedroom. Right? How does your trauma play out in the bedroom?

574
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:47,587
And I choked. Jocko mo. And then he said, Stop,

575
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,662
I'm normal.

576
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:55,100
When you choke, you ask first. You just do it. Why would I ask?

577
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,650
Because then it could be a no.

578
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:01,562
The rapist applause.

579
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:07,032
Do you ask before you joke a guy? I don't. It's caused

580
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:10,312
problems. No,

581
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,762
I'm not gay. I guess, you know,

582
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:16,947
genders aren't a thing anymore, Karen. No. It's all lucid,

583
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:20,152
baby. Yeah. So women can choke first now?

584
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,462
Yeah. Put that on your Hinge profile.

585
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:28,412
I choke first and I'm a comedian.

586
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,327
Anybody have fucking quote? He's a life alert. Zero matches.

587
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:36,652
Okay. That was hilarious. I thought, though,

588
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,475
too. Thank you. I'm going to come to that later.

589
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:44,902
Okay. It's come to the time when

590
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,472
we need a couple more volunteers on stage. These also

591
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:52,775
should be men. Another loan stakes like that.

592
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:57,177
How not to rape, I promise. They're probably leaving.

593
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:00,962
We got some voluntary.

594
00:37:07,162 --> 00:37:10,700
All right. Hi. Tell me more. Do we well,

595
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,300
we can do three. People more come up. Thanks.

596
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:18,352
That works. That guy just got up and he said, okay, I'll do it.

597
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:22,692
Hey, you guys. They listen. This is probably the easiest

598
00:37:22,752 --> 00:37:26,377
segment that we have on the show. Yes, truly. And there is a

599
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:30,022
prize. There is a prize. There's always a prize. Okay, so this one is

600
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,612
very simple. You guys will introduce themselves. We have four, but that's

601
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:37,377
numbers aren't a thing. As Game Festival,

602
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:40,852
we're like three and like, we'll do four. I know what they

603
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,167
mean. They did four. They said three, but they need four.

604
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:47,602
You're fucking women. And all

605
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,827
you have to do is you're going to go down the table and you're going

606
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:54,262
to compliment each one of us on something that you

607
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:58,192
can't see. Okay. And if you've seen

608
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,800
it on Reddit, don't compliment that either.

609
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,367
But not aesthetic. That is a good point. But yeah,

610
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,057
it can't be like a part of it can't be like because Karen's wearing a

611
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,087
bra, you compliment her. Just so I'm clear.

612
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,627
Yeah. You seem to already keep it or. Something that I know about you

613
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:20,225
that I like. It has to be a quality.

614
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:23,600
A quality. It's not visual. Yeah.

615
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:30,757
TikTok with this one. So before I start, I was here a

616
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,597
year ago in Houston. That's when I met you guys. I got into

617
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:38,002
this whole podcast. So I really enjoy your guys'work. Thank you so

618
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,472
much. Well, you're already in first place, so thank you. No worries.

619
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:44,450
And the condos is over. What's your name?

620
00:38:44,962 --> 00:38:48,287
I'm Joe. I'm here with my buddy Tommy.

621
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:52,712
We're both sailors in the Navy.

622
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:55,025
Now I know why you.

623
00:38:58,012 --> 00:39:01,102
One by one first. This is my first time meeting you.

624
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,000
Thanks.

625
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:08,122
A very good quality that I see about you is that you're clearly on something

626
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:12,062
right now, and I love it. No, I'm actually sober.

627
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:16,025
She's trying hard to be sober. Actually.

628
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:24,342
Don't take that as a reason to do something later. Please quote retard

629
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:25,325
over here.

630
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:33,287
This is so accurate.

631
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:38,577
Holy shit. Holy shit.

632
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:42,142
Christina? Yes. I saw your set yesterday, and your

633
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,827
rape joke was the best rape joke I've ever heard. Oh, my god. Thank you

634
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:48,097
so much. An easy compliment. Okay. Not a joke in this

635
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,725
room.

636
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:57,577
This is going to be a challenging one. Inflection in that.

637
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,522
Okay. I was very surprised and impressed that you

638
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:04,572
own your own business with a baseball

639
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:08,052
card. Yeah, my dad died. Hey, what? Started mine

640
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:09,737
last year. We're in the same bucket.

641
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:15,587
And finally again, first time meeting

642
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:19,325
karen. Totally. I forgot what we're doing.

643
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:25,262
So sorry. I am ready to welcome your compliment.

644
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:30,367
Thank you. I would say out of the four panelists here,

645
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,087
you have the best sense of humor.

646
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:40,400
Comes out of nowhere and starts beating him up.

647
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:45,847
Thank you for participating. Thank you. That was a good one. You fell for the

648
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,642
old pitting women against each other. He will fall

649
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,537
for it. Thank you. Catfight on the LSV.

650
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:58,462
All right. That's number two. Matt. Matt. Okay.

651
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,042
Hello. Another matt. All right. You may go now.

652
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:04,925
Okay. Am I supposed to be calling all. Of you or just

653
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:07,625
can't be that hard.

654
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:21,067
The other guy. Three nice compliments in one

655
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:23,675
mean just like the other guy.

656
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:30,437
You better get your compliments.

657
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:36,822
Will we break our sobriety? I don't know who's getting chloe.

658
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:40,527
I love how you manage to take your trauma

659
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:44,392
and turn into so much charities. You think these are so

660
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,425
bad. Okay.

661
00:41:57,037 --> 00:42:00,397
Oh, god. I really,

662
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,472
really love your story that you did on this is not

663
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:07,177
happening. About the jealousy that you were battling with.

664
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:10,100
I'm sure everyone can relate to that. Thank you.

665
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,857
The hesitancy before me every time. I know what to say to

666
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,987
you. No, I love you on master

667
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:22,437
show and I really enjoyed you every time you're allegiance tanks

668
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:25,325
and something no one's ever said before.

669
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:32,375
I enjoy it very much. And then

670
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:34,850
karen. Yes.

671
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:45,712
I like karen. I don't really give a shit about what everyone

672
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:47,237
thinks about me attitude.

673
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:54,425
How do you feel?

674
00:42:57,712 --> 00:43:00,547
It was kind of a joke that this would be hard and now to see

675
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,750
how actually challenging it is,

676
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:06,982
it gets proven itself hurtful to us. Right.

677
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,727
We really walked in our own chat.

678
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:12,292
There's like five minutes like,

679
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,025
hey, we're going to put this in. You shouldn't need five minutes for one thing.

680
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,012
You can pass the mic. Thank you for participating.

681
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:24,202
Number four. Hi. Hello. Hi. How are you doing? Good. How are you?

682
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:27,887
Chilling. I'm good. Nice voice.

683
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:34,262
Now, what's your name? Phil. Phil, you made compliment

684
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,025
is hard. I was thinking the whole time.

685
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:41,975
From start fill. Okay.

686
00:43:43,612 --> 00:43:47,077
It can't be anything I see with my eyes. Just saying. I know. That's the

687
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:48,125
challenge. Exactly.

688
00:43:50,737 --> 00:43:54,062
You could do something with your eyes. No, that's not the rules.

689
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:57,322
That's the whole point of the challenge. We might have to do a follow up

690
00:43:57,355 --> 00:44:00,287
segment so that could keep going alive for sunday.

691
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:06,492
I think you're all very funny. First of all, you can't do a group compliment.

692
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:10,187
No group compliment you have to choose who's the funniest.

693
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:17,975
The other three will just kill ourselves. Yeah.

694
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:21,757
Do you want blood on your mouth? Like dear Phil. Thanks,

695
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:25,527
asshole. I like your voice.

696
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:29,347
Thank you. Something you can hear. All right,

697
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,527
well, I can't see your voice. I like your

698
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,787
curly hair. I don't know if that's visual.

699
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:39,637
Feel my curly hair. My hair didn't touch your heart.

700
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,362
He was so proud of himself cause he didn't say tits.

701
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:46,747
He thought that was going to be a win. I like your show. Your show

702
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,625
is cool. Which one? This one.

703
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:57,307
Jesus Christ. All right. Are you really trying,

704
00:44:57,385 --> 00:45:00,562
or I think. It'S been on the spot or whatever.

705
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,907
I don't know. You've been standing in line so he

706
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,800
has time to think. Yeah.

707
00:45:09,337 --> 00:45:12,650
I had a carnival. He's like, I didn't know this first wheel went up.

708
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,325
I wish you asked me, how do I not rape questions.

709
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,925
Okay, corinne, how do you not rape her?

710
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:27,072
I don't. What? I just don't.

711
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:30,952
None. I felt her fault somehow. Now I'm

712
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,182
offended. I don't know what to say, cause. It'S the wrong segment.

713
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:37,717
You know? Go again on something

714
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:39,500
you can't see. Go again.

715
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:44,757
Compliment. The compliment. You know, the challenge. No, we switched

716
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:48,725
the insults mid game. Just forget her.

717
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:54,097
I think you're very quick witted, and you come

718
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,467
up with stuff on the. Spot really well, so yeah. Quick witted?

719
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,725
Yeah. Wow.

720
00:46:03,562 --> 00:46:07,037
You have the same qualities. Thank you. No, I don't.

721
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:11,012
Well, men fall for stuff, too. That's so funny.

722
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:18,212
Okay. Go ahead, Karen. Okay. I like the Valenciaga.

723
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:29,300
See, you're representing people of color right now. Be better.

724
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:33,397
I'm white. Are you? No, I'm like oh. I was like,

725
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,650
Jesus Christ. My LASIK is inspired. Okay.

726
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:39,887
Holy shit. You scared me, Phil.

727
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:44,097
Karen, I love every time you're on the Realized podcast.

728
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:47,442
I think you're funny as fuck. Thanks, Matt. A really good one. Thanks, Phil.

729
00:46:47,502 --> 00:46:51,177
Not Pat, but all right. Thank you. At least you remembered

730
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:54,425
that. He's never going to forget you now. All right,

731
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:57,837
what's your name? Josh. Josh. What do you do for a living, Josh?

732
00:46:57,912 --> 00:47:01,325
I'm a comedian. But really, what do you do for a living?

733
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:16,767
Okay. It's really smart. I have a 60 year old fucking

734
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:20,797
roommate. Like that one guy's girlfriend. Are you fucking him? I'm trying.

735
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,975
Wow. For rent money? Yeah.

736
00:47:24,787 --> 00:47:26,300
Got to do something for home.

737
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:34,250
I'm going to start on that end. Karen, I love your bank account.

738
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,867
I love your bank account. Did you give him money? I don't know.

739
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:44,322
He can smell it, too. Yeah, he's fucking

740
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:47,662
vulnerable. Corinne without

741
00:47:47,725 --> 00:47:51,052
a country is one of my favorite podcasts that my ex wife used to make

742
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,442
me listen to. Wow. It was a compliment first, and then

743
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:58,177
what? A roller coaster of compliments. Cannot get past

744
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,100
something without a loaded compliment. I love it.

745
00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:04,957
You're the better host, everyone. I've been a

746
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,272
host the whole time. But you've had other co hosts, and you've been the best

747
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:11,752
one. Okay. Thank you. Why'd you

748
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,025
and your ex white break.

749
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:20,497
I don't want to get into that. You brought it up. I know.

750
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,275
I did.

751
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:31,487
Show in Vegas. That's what happens when you make Chloe wait for her compliment.

752
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:38,647
Christina, I think you're really good at

753
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,900
cutting down men. Oh, my God. Thank you. You're welcome.

754
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:46,250
That's a good one. And, Chloe, you're the funniest one up here.

755
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:50,542
Thank you. Thank you so much.

756
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:51,887
Clean up, banana.

757
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:58,025
Thanks, dude. I really needed that.

758
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:02,052
Okay. All right, we just had a little meeting

759
00:49:02,082 --> 00:49:05,377
over here and we decided that none of you win.

760
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:08,772
Thank you for participating, though. This segment was for us. You may take a seat.

761
00:49:08,817 --> 00:49:12,742
Thank you so much. I think the homeless guy won.

762
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,887
Yeah, for sure, baby.

763
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,800
A for effort. Wood. All right.

764
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:25,452
Who are you talking about? Almost got wood.

765
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:29,122
Yeah. No idea. I got that part. Okay, well, you have

766
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:33,072
a home. You probably fuck pretty good. Yeah. Have you ever fucked a homeless

767
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:36,882
guy? Kinda elaborate.

768
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:40,062
I met this guy in reab named Tommy who was addicted to crack.

769
00:49:40,137 --> 00:49:44,752
And we had sex a lot, but he

770
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,800
didn't sleep much, so I didn't have to share the bed with

771
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:53,202
rehab? No. After, because he was on crack.

772
00:49:53,382 --> 00:49:55,850
He went right back to crack when he yeah.

773
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:59,675
I find a stable life with you.

774
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:02,687
No, I drove him back to crack.

775
00:50:05,812 --> 00:50:09,622
Wait. Oh, that's a great question. So how many people have

776
00:50:09,655 --> 00:50:13,132
turned to drugs after you robot? Well,

777
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,237
mom and dad. Now they're divorced.

778
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:24,275
Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Hail says no.

779
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:34,942
I don't know. Probably him. Jockamo someone

780
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,437
that rhymes with Phyllis.

781
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:41,987
Bane. Phyllis. Okay. Garen bin.

782
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:46,762
That's it. Shut up. Did I talk to the girl?

783
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,292
Yeah. Really? Yeah. I feel like it was kind of. Rape,

784
00:50:50,352 --> 00:50:53,827
but, uhoh was it? Yeah, because we were making all these

785
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:57,397
pina coladas, right? And the next day I was like, that was weird last night.

786
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,387
And she was like, Why? Mine were virgin.

787
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:04,852
I'm like where? I no longer am one. Oh, wow. Was it your

788
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:07,882
babysitter? No, it was this girl. I can't say who.

789
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,527
And she's really hot, you know,

790
00:51:11,545 --> 00:51:14,952
like a ten, but it wasn't

791
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:18,062
for me. Lesbian sex or lesbian.

792
00:51:18,637 --> 00:51:21,907
Yeah. Being gays. Not for me. Raped by a

793
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,425
woman? Yeah, it might be that part.

794
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:27,757
Have you attacked with a woman? Yeah. A lot.

795
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:31,492
Yeah. Damn. What about you, Gogo? I let

796
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,337
a woman finger me to save her marriage at a sex club.

797
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:38,472
Did it save her marriage? I think it might have saved her marriage,

798
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:42,437
but she had an acrylic on and it really hurt in my pussy.

799
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:46,207
But I felt like it was a mitzvah for a woman, you know? So it

800
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,032
was nice. But yeah, at one point I reached back just because

801
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,947
I was like, I'm not really enjoying this. And I didn't think she was either.

802
00:51:54,055 --> 00:51:57,787
So I just reached back to feel if her vagina was wet. And it was

803
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,937
very dry.

804
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:06,800
Investigate. Have you ever talked to a woman yet? Just in college.

805
00:52:07,162 --> 00:52:10,977
That's so basic. Yeah, that's so basic.

806
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:14,527
We were bartenders and I went to finger her and we stopped. I was like,

807
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:17,967
nobody's watching us. You're not doing it for attention

808
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:20,675
at this point. There's no point. No money.

809
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:25,597
Well, Karen, you've been making a shit ton of money on

810
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,800
only fans. Yeah.

811
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:32,617
How many people here are subscribed to Karen's? Only fans. Okay,

812
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:35,837
guys, so be a friend. You guys are full of fucking shit.

813
00:52:36,262 --> 00:52:39,172
I see her pulling up an Uber VIP all the time. I've been to her

814
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:43,087
house. This was good. We're doing great work.

815
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,887
Yeah, the donations.

816
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:51,877
We've asked a lot of questions about your only vets because we're very impressed by

817
00:52:51,895 --> 00:52:55,147
it. But can you give us some tips for people who wanted

818
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,300
to get into the sex work? Do you want to start the only fans here

819
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:07,672
you are not one competition. No, yeah, it's fine.

820
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:10,175
I mean, we can try to stick in the herd. Yeah.

821
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:15,877
The thing about only fans is like, the weirder you are, the better.

822
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,507
Like you don't know people's Google searches, right? Do you

823
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,462
have warts? Like really start showcasing them.

824
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:24,887
Really? Are you serious?

825
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:29,707
Not that I do, but if I feel

826
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,962
like this is a trick,

827
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,775
you bitch and I'm going to put you on a train.

828
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:42,657
You should be a pioneer, Karen. It's like the first guy you put handicapped porn

829
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:45,727
on, you're like earhart. She never came back. No,

830
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:48,997
but you shouldn't feel insurious about, like you're like

831
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,942
weird shit. You should feel good about it. That's the stuff that people are into.

832
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,547
I was going to do one for my feet. I was going to put googly

833
00:53:56,592 --> 00:54:00,052
eyes on the toes. I was ruining it. I feel like I would be

834
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,067
pissed at me. If you like, maybe wrap those feet around a disc,

835
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,975
it might work. Yeah, right. No.

836
00:54:12,337 --> 00:54:15,817
My dog has ruined but I don't know. I think it's cute. Like so many

837
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:19,777
videos. So what are you doing? Like writing? It'll be

838
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:22,262
like an India re song.

839
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:27,127
I'm glad it's just funny to you guys. But I'll be like,

840
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:30,275
bent over and then my dog will come in a frame and I'll be like,

841
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:36,500
not the dicks line out. I'll give you peanut butter later.

842
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:42,942
How many people are you into? Like silly like a silly sexual

843
00:54:43,002 --> 00:54:47,032
encounter. Yeah, that's what I thought.

844
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:50,812
Okay, who's going to come skipping towards the rest? Me. I like better

845
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:54,217
than powder. I feel like,

846
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,225
baby, let's figure this out.

847
00:55:04,912 --> 00:55:07,912
That's a big one. I mean, I wouldn't know,

848
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:15,337
but diaper. Play anybody who

849
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,367
sold her shit in. A tupperware for like five K. Yeah.

850
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,322
What the fuck? For free. A lot of money.

851
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:24,417
I've been just flushing that down the door. She owns two homes.

852
00:55:24,477 --> 00:55:28,237
Wow. She's got way more baggage than that. Worth more,

853
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,662
too. Because I put it all in doggie bags.

854
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:35,572
The poop dumps like an elephant. That should be your

855
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,692
dump. Fuck an elephant. No, dumps like an elephant. Oh,

856
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,292
dumps like a that should be. Your only fanfree name.

857
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,537
You know, I don't know. They're getting a shot. I like that she was surprised

858
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:48,212
when she thought you said, dumb fucking elephant.

859
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,972
My mommy never told me that. Yeah, it's like Chloe the Great instead

860
00:55:53,005 --> 00:55:55,412
of Catherine the Great. The way I died.

861
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:59,497
She got fucked by a horse and she died. Catherine the great.

862
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:03,307
Really? Yeah. Why is that like a party fact that

863
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,202
you have at the tip of your tongue? Did you see a video of it?

864
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,472
I'm really smart. Wait, did they

865
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:12,575
capture her and then let a horse fuck her? No,

866
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:17,612
she just didn't. She just wanted to do it. She was like the queen.

867
00:56:18,937 --> 00:56:21,662
She was like, you guys hold our black eyes in the palace.

868
00:56:23,437 --> 00:56:27,157
I got to get my size. I love that as a

869
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,662
party fat. Christina, do you have a party fat that used to impress suits?

870
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,837
You think I use that to impress?

871
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:38,052
I mean, I can start talking about. How aliens are real, and I start citing

872
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:39,800
evidence, and then I'm like, Where are you going?

873
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:44,947
They are, though I like to tell people bats have a belly button. I think

874
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,547
that's really cool thank you. Vibe right away.

875
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:52,677
Yeah. Well, you know what a funny thing is? I've had three separate boyfriends

876
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:55,487
give me taxidermy bats as a gift.

877
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:59,887
I've never had one taxidermy bat. I love all three

878
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,202
of them. The night sometimes killed a rat. Until right here.

879
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,862
Yes. Corinne, did you name them? No,

880
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,452
I didn't even I named my taxes. Jeremy Coyote, though. But not my bad what's

881
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:13,787
his name? Selena. It's after a Breaking Bad episode.

882
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:17,537
Karen.

883
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:25,297
Are you on shrooms right now? Are you

884
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,152
on Shrooms? I know. Are you in bonding?

885
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:50,572
This the

886
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:53,872
question is, do you have, like, a fun party fact that you use on

887
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:57,717
day to impress Tooth? I know. The god of partying.

888
00:57:57,777 --> 00:58:04,432
It's Dionysis getting

889
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,092
all these other gods. He's the party god, right?

890
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:11,457
ISIS. Stupid. I thought you meant,

891
00:58:11,472 --> 00:58:15,275
like, you were trying to join ISIS. You're already in it.

892
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,675
She's already getting into.

893
00:58:19,387 --> 00:58:23,197
Happy. She is. She has a fucking vest on full of bonds. Wait,

894
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,450
so are you seeing shit right now? Obviously.

895
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:41,272
Thank you. All right, well, I think we've reached our

896
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:43,850
last interactive segment of the show.

897
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,512
There is a price for this, and this is the one where we're I mean,

898
00:58:47,575 --> 00:58:50,632
depending on who you are and how you feel the most or the least of

899
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:53,947
you, I'm not really sure. Your emotional intelligence is so low. I can't really

900
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,127
gauge this. Nothing to do with

901
00:58:57,145 --> 00:59:00,577
emotional intelligence. I think we have to tell them all

902
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:04,302
this. We can't just expect this of you. Okay, very respectful,

903
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,867
we do not tell. You what this segment is. Yeah, we have this

904
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:11,452
crazy idea just for really no reason in

905
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,572
a very low level prize that you

906
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:18,447
would come and show us your dick, only we'll

907
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:21,507
see it. No one in the audience will see it and review it, and we'll

908
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:22,862
review your dick.

909
00:59:28,312 --> 00:59:31,447
And so the five components of criteria for this

910
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,347
dick review are and it's not necessarily the

911
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,692
best. It's just like, what we feel in the moment.

912
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,707
And you guys, according to our DMs. Y'All want to show us,

913
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,502
right? We're kind of

914
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,700
giving you this opportunity.

915
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:51,875
Let us look at you. Yeah, give us something. You know what I mean?

916
00:59:53,062 --> 00:59:56,162
Show us your body. Bring us your decks.

917
00:59:57,562 --> 01:00:00,982
I'm going to chop your head off because I'm an ISIS behind the

918
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:04,177
black curtain. Okay? So we will react to it, but. No one else will see

919
01:00:04,195 --> 01:00:07,597
your day. So just know that show the

920
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,812
components are going to be girth length that'd.

921
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:11,975
Be soft or hard.

922
01:00:24,262 --> 01:00:27,607
And then character, which I think is like the one that really is going

923
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:31,827
to give one of you a leg on this. Can you imagine fucking

924
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:34,487
a guy and then going, oh, that's your dad's character.

925
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:40,657
And then he cries and develops, has. A little bit of character there.

926
01:00:40,735 --> 01:00:43,475
I can see it. All right.

927
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:46,637
He's apologiamadi of Venus.

928
01:00:47,962 --> 01:00:51,877
Okay, thank you. No one here

929
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:55,912
has seen any character movies with I have

930
01:00:55,975 --> 01:00:59,892
Big Fat Liar. Fat liar with Paul Giamatti.

931
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:03,050
Oh, okay. That's a Paul Gemati movie. Yeah.

932
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,437
He's like, can we play the movie?

933
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:11,375
I didn't know where to go from there. All right.

934
01:01:17,662 --> 01:01:22,262
I'll give you a free subscription to my only fans. We have a volunteer.

935
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:27,875
Brave. Four dicks is a party. Here we go.

936
01:01:28,537 --> 01:01:29,600
Let's go.

937
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:38,272
I don't actually know how to do that. We're going to make a really big

938
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:41,592
deal about the one that wins.

939
01:01:41,652 --> 01:01:44,482
Okay, I have an idea. What if we put them in order of who we

940
01:01:44,485 --> 01:01:47,757
think is the smallest? You don't

941
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:51,337
know. That's a good

942
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,297
gag. Quo literally a gag once

943
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,527
it gets to me. Unless it's

944
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:02,122
a carrot. Okay, let's go. All right, so we're going to have you stand

945
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:05,472
behind this one, right? The scrim. Well, I thought we were not going to sexually

946
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:09,427
assault the producer when you

947
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:13,087
guys go over to this one because there's other adults behind this one

948
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,225
running the show.

949
01:02:17,062 --> 01:02:20,857
Okay, so this three guys do one at a time, unless you guys just want

950
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,502
to see each other's digs. Would it make you guys feel more comfortable if

951
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,102
you all showed us your Dixon unison and we went down the. Line and we

952
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,402
need to see them being used? No, we didn't say that.

953
01:02:31,495 --> 01:02:34,542
We didn't say that. Anything Chloe says is a haha.

954
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:37,187
Okay. It's a little lol.

955
01:02:37,912 --> 01:02:41,532
I want to get a good view. Me too. Everybody's, I'm going to come quote.

956
01:02:41,697 --> 01:02:45,067
I was just walking closer. Okay. This is very exciting for me.

957
01:02:45,115 --> 01:02:48,657
Okay. You are so right. I don't

958
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:50,525
even know what your name is. Wait.

959
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,975
Okay. Wow. That's a dick right there.

960
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:03,277
That's a good one. It's a dark tank. It's almost longer than

961
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:06,772
your ball. You're a thrower. Keep talking. It feels like it's getting

962
01:03:06,805 --> 01:03:07,850
a little harder. Yeah.

963
01:03:10,837 --> 01:03:12,575
Come on, show us how big.

964
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:17,787
It's a good boy. Okay. There's a red rocket.

965
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:20,462
Okay. We just start touching ourselves.

966
01:03:21,637 --> 01:03:24,697
All right. I don't see a lot of those in ISIS, I'll tell you that

967
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,712
much. We're not allowed to wait.

968
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:31,867
What's your name? Ryan. Not the first time I've asked after

969
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:35,772
I've seen the deck. Okay Ryan. Next contestant.

970
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:37,787
Thank you. Congrats, Ryan.

971
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:43,700
I'm not telling you. You will show us your record.

972
01:03:46,837 --> 01:03:50,332
No traumatizes a kid. He's like, I'll show you my dad. I'm not telling you

973
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:51,350
my fucking name.

974
01:03:56,212 --> 01:04:00,717
It has, like, a spring to it. No helicopter.

975
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:04,100
Like a cat tail is the helicopter time.

976
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:08,427
He's a helicopter now. He keeps pulling

977
01:04:08,457 --> 01:04:11,162
his underwear down lower. As a vet.

978
01:04:12,937 --> 01:04:16,327
Yeah. You're trying to get character points. Okay. Thank you for showing us your

979
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:18,125
dig. I'm going to throw up.

980
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:23,000
No, because I'm dizzy from the helicopter. Okay,

981
01:04:24,037 --> 01:04:27,427
got it. Thank you for showing us your dig. That was wonderful. Thank you so

982
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:31,177
much. Contestant. Yeah. I don't know why the fuck any of you agree to

983
01:04:31,195 --> 01:04:34,687
this, but I feel like the line got longer. Okay, ready?

984
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,825
What? The line got longer. Let's see. What's your name?

985
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:42,575
Yeah. Okay.

986
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:47,097
He's doing the numbers aren't in your favor. That's doing it slow.

987
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:50,527
And he's, like, unbuckling his belt, and he's kind of doing like a

988
01:04:50,545 --> 01:04:53,542
Vegas showboy move. Oh, my God.

989
01:04:53,665 --> 01:04:57,592
Nothing has made me more uncomfortable than what set is doing. Me too.

990
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:00,942
Lift up the blouse. All right, Seth,

991
01:05:01,002 --> 01:05:04,447
you got a z muscle and a dick and ball. Look at that dick right

992
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,697
there. Nicer body. Yours was a bit wider.

993
01:05:08,892 --> 01:05:12,800
Wide balls. Very wide balls so far right

994
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:16,732
here. Ball width was it in the components, but we might have to add it

995
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:22,550
for Sad touch.

996
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:26,727
Don't shake hands with Sad. Okay. Don't congratulate

997
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:30,127
him on this. Yeah. Why does ball so far? Thank you,

998
01:05:30,145 --> 01:05:34,072
Sad. We've seen it. Thank you very far.

999
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,462
All right. Running away from each other. All right. Come on

1000
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:40,212
in. What's your name? More comfortable?

1001
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:44,162
Dwayne. Oh, my God. Dwayne works here. I have parents for Dwayne.

1002
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:47,902
Dwayne is am also. He works here. Is this going to

1003
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,112
get us in trouble?

1004
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:54,427
Okay. Dwayne is also touching it,

1005
01:05:54,595 --> 01:06:01,487
and he works here, so God knows where that hands going to go after Dwayne.

1006
01:06:03,187 --> 01:06:06,437
You have fraternal twin balls,

1007
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:09,800
and I like that about you.

1008
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:14,825
Karen. Are you seeing something to say other than that? What? We're seeing

1009
01:06:15,712 --> 01:06:18,125
how badly he wants to show her.

1010
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:24,547
Happy trip, Karen. Happy. I like the way you rest your

1011
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,877
hands right now. Just like, a little bit, like, three inches away from

1012
01:06:27,895 --> 01:06:31,552
the body on each side. You're kind of going back.

1013
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,387
Dwayne's kind of like, nervous to do show and tell and preserve

1014
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:40,552
babies. Yeah. His underwear and pants are

1015
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:44,437
just here. And he's laughing so hard that. His deck is

1016
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,462
moving like Joe Biden. Is looking for a handshake.

1017
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:52,112
Like Santa's full of jelly belly.

1018
01:06:53,362 --> 01:06:56,107
What went through your head, Dwayne, when you were like, I work here, but I

1019
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,112
should also show my dick.

1020
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:02,917
What he's still showing us? Oh, he's showing us the path that says all

1021
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,075
access. That feels so rape. Okay,

1022
01:07:06,337 --> 01:07:10,522
you can pull up it. We're also doing an added component of who

1023
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,837
just had no inclination to pull up the pants after

1024
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,937
showing it. Dwayne wins by a landslide.

1025
01:07:18,787 --> 01:07:22,482
Okay. All right. We can't have the audience. If you didn't see that's,

1026
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:26,097
it give. Them a round of applause. That was wonderful being fearless. I honestly

1027
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,675
can't believe we convinced you to yeah, I'm really impressed with you.

1028
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:37,787
We have to both you just went back to their feet in shame,

1029
01:07:38,212 --> 01:07:41,227
right? Okay. We have to remember them. Yeah,

1030
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:45,097
we have to remember them. Yeah, I remember it. Okay, so again, we're going

1031
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,575
off girth, length, coloring, vinaige, and character like

1032
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:51,875
vinaige. I didn't write that one down.

1033
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:56,457
You didn't write down vinaig. Okay. I didn't see a lot of veins, but that's

1034
01:07:56,472 --> 01:08:00,202
because they were flaccid so far away. Yeah, also far away, but I'm

1035
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,892
near sighted. I didn't see any veins. Yeah, I didn't see any veins. That's something

1036
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,075
to do with your site.

1037
01:08:07,312 --> 01:08:10,400
Really good dicks, though, you guys. All of you. All right,

1038
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:14,167
so if you guys can't remember the names, you can also vote by 1234.

1039
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,925
Chloe, what are your thoughts? Oh,

1040
01:08:17,962 --> 01:08:21,652
I'm going to go with I

1041
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:25,347
have a soft spot for Dwayne,

1042
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:28,867
and I think we both share

1043
01:08:28,915 --> 01:08:32,802
the soft spot. Right. Get it. There are several

1044
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:36,247
soft spots, so yeah. I'm going to go with

1045
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,612
that. No, I'm going to go with Dwayne. I got to support the festival.

1046
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:42,822
Yes. I also am going to go with Wayne, because he was the most excited

1047
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:46,002
to show us and had his pants down the longest and was just the bravest.

1048
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:48,957
So I'm going to go with Wayne. Yeah. I'm also going to go with Dwayne.

1049
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:52,037
I don't know that he'll ever be voted in a dick contest,

1050
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:57,012
so this is going to be his one opportunity where underdogs

1051
01:08:57,162 --> 01:09:00,950
flourish, it feels like if I don't vote for Dwayne no,

1052
01:09:02,962 --> 01:09:06,277
Karen, dwayne is already won, so this is

1053
01:09:06,295 --> 01:09:09,727
really just you. And I want to give a little festival award. Let me get

1054
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,800
one more look at all of them. Second looks,

1055
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:17,587
last looks, everybody back to show.

1056
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:21,247
The winner has to show everyone their dicks. Yeah. They did not

1057
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,537
agree to that. No, they don't. Chloe and your non rules.

1058
01:09:24,612 --> 01:09:27,552
Good prize. Wayne, get over here. Congratulations.

1059
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:31,002
You won the dick competition and a free copy of Club Pink Sex,

1060
01:09:31,032 --> 01:09:34,777
but you can show us every day. Wait, can you go to the microphone for

1061
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:38,302
a second? This is for me. Can you say, I'm Dwayne, whatever your last name

1062
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,997
is, and I just won best dick at Skank Fest. I am Dwayne

1063
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:45,350
Howard. I won the best dick at Skank Fest. Thank you.

1064
01:09:47,362 --> 01:09:50,225

1068
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:05,352
our show. We really appreciate it. I'm Christina Hutchinson. I'm corinne Fisher.

1069
01:10:05,382 --> 01:10:08,782
