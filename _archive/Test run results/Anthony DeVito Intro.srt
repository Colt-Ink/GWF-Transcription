1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:04,147
Just kidding. Oh, good. It's not that.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,512
It's not that. It's just feminist.

3
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:10,342
I'm recording, so whenever you want, go for it.

4
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:16,677
Hi calls

5
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:20,002
Portland. I was at a cafe this morning, and a girl talked like that,

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,747
and I looked over, and it was like a grown woman, and I was like,

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,072
Stop talking. Well, apparently that's

8
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:30,757
fine. Apparently the line in Tyler Swift's song is, like, I used to know

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,542
if I feel like everyone's a sexy baby is her commenting

10
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:39,097
on women who help

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,102
me. I'm a baby. Also, you're doing a lot of stone damage to

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,302
her vocal cords. What if that was my sexy baby?

13
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:49,747
My sexy baby? It's just like I sound like I'm dying. Somebody's got a

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,542
piano string around your neck. Hey,

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,902
fuckers. How you doing? How you been? You good? You're all right? You're hanging in

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,922
there? Well, welcome to another episode of Guys we effect.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,912
It's the anti flutching podcast. I'm corrine Fischer.

18
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:07,237
Christina Hutchinson. Welcome to the goddamn show. Here.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,800
We're here. Let's get into it. Let's read an email.

20
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,027
Do you want to read this, or do you want me to? Sure, I'll read

21
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,797
if you want. You can read it. I couldn't be my boyfriend's

22
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:20,602
dead mom, and he made it my fault. It sounds

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,222
like it was your fault. What a title. Wait. I couldn't be my boyfriend's dead

24
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,450
mom, and he made it my fault? Okay.

25
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:32,752
Another stellar gentleman making an appearance. Hi, guys. I really love

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,077
the show. I've been listening for years, and I know I'm better for it.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,052
I still have some dumb bitch in me, though. We all do.

28
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,427
My ex and I broke up this week. He 30, lost his mom a year

29
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:48,737
and a half ago, and he won't stop yapping.

30
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:53,002
My mom died because this is

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,302
not triggering because of my last breakup. She had

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,767
been sick for a long time. We started dating about six months after she

33
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,307
passed, and that's called too soon. Learn that the hard way.

34
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,697
I'm 24 and feel like this was the first relationship I really put

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,027
my all into. He got time. Yeah. I mean, you're making a little bit

36
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,507
about, yo, I have a man you

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,002
could call. I have a friend who you

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,287
could text. He expressed early on that

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,932
he wanted more from me, and I stepped up as much as I could.

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,067
Like, anal or, like, emotional. So probably emotional. Probably not analy.

41
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:32,527
Yeah. I got to say no. And there

42
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:35,312
was no stage of grief where I was like, I want it up the butt.

43
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:37,325
All the holes are nothing.

44
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:42,217
I was vulnerable and sensitive to what he's going through.

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,062
I mean, his mom died. I'm guessing that you were vulnerable

46
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:49,662
and sensitive in the way that, again, so ironic.

47
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,600
Only a 24 year old could be, which is not a lot

48
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:57,852
for the people in the back of the room, because we're talking about therapy

49
00:02:57,882 --> 00:03:01,527
for weeks. It's not a lot. So that one more year development.

50
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,425
Oh, God. Okay.

51
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:09,662
I told him everything. That's not helpful when you're going through death.

52
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:13,597
So, anyway, about me, you know what I loved? When?

53
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:17,422
Right after my dad's died, just a long story about my boyfriend day at

54
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:19,037
work. That was really helpful.

55
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:24,697
I told him everything. He's the first person I opened up to about so many

56
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,657
things, and he listened. So compassionately and respectfully.

57
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:31,347
Honestly shocking, considering the death of his mother was only six months prior.

58
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:35,377
Maybe it was just my first adult relationship, but the emotional connection and trust I

59
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,377
felt with him was like nothing I've ever had. And I'm scared I won't have

60
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:41,977
it again. Girl, you're 24. Yeah, to buy that

61
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,992
at the supermarket. Over the course of our relationship,

62
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:48,607
more things happen with his family. His brother and him had a falling out,

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,482
and then his brother was committed to a mental hospital,

64
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,842
and then his dad started romantically dating his dead

65
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,622
mom's sister. That's a lot of lairs. We should be more respectful

66
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,767
to you, actually. Shit, that's a lot.

67
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:05,825
Drama. That's a lot. Drama. That's a lot.

68
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:10,222
I need a button that says drama. I can just see her being like,

69
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:13,152
god, my boyfriend should just get a tattoo on his wrist that says, I hate

70
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:17,167
drama because he loves it. Drama in my life.

71
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:21,892
Honestly, I'm not sure if anyone can take any

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,192
of that well. But he struggled and had a hard time letting me

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,687
support him. Plus, I had a hard time knowing how to support him.

74
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,957
And I feel you on that, because I would be like, don't talk to me.

75
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:35,452
And then I'd be like, I open talks. That would

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,027
be confusing. Leave me alone,

77
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:40,325
but come over.

78
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,527
That's the scales of the libra. That's what they're talking about. One side is

79
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,272
saying, Leave me alone. And one side is saying, Come over. Well, what you say

80
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:53,992
and what you want, two different things. He is looking

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,802
for what makes him happy. He feels like he cannot continue living like he

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,747
is working in the city, living in Brooklyn. Brooklyn difficult.

83
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:05,427
I know that subway. Going out with friends. Basically how most normal

84
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:09,437
people live in NYC. In hindsight, the relationship should have ended sooner.

85
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,582
It probably shouldn't have even started. Oh, boy.

86
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:17,497
I wasn't getting what I needed. I was exhausting myself trying

87
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,902
to give what he needed, and it still wasn't enough for him. When he's not

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,232
making this up, this is actually what the reader wrote us. The writer wrote us

89
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,652
when he initiated the breakup last week. He said, you don't feel like home to

90
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,182
me. I don't think he really has a home right now. Speaking of liberty's

91
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,447
on the tone, though, we don't know.

92
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:37,447
His family is so fucked up, and he's trying to fill that void with a

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,152
relationship. That's every relationship that I've ever been in. I mean, not on

94
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,497
my end, but done with the other person, sure. But no, he's not.

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,782
He's dedumped you. So is he trying to fill the void with the relationship?

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,647
Did he dump, or did they break out? I thought you don't feel like home

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,127
to me. I mean, that's me. Oh, right, right. Oh, he initiated it.

98
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,502
He initiated. Okay. Yes. So I don't think you're trying

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,982
to fill the void with the relationship. He dumped you. If he was doing that,

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,402
he would be more codependent with you. Seems like he was traumatized, and he was

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,827
like, I'm gonna traumatize this bitch by having her go through the first breakup

102
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:10,792
she's ever been through. We're all playing hot potato with our pain, guys.

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,657
Oh, man. His family is so fucked up. He's trying to follow the void with

104
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,217
our relationship. Shortly before the breakup, my dad was diagnosed with cancer.

105
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,062
Wow. You guys can't have a moment to this guy by himself.

106
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:26,092
It's been really difficult, but my ex relates to it, and I was a yes,

107
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,527
of course. Also, God, I feel like this is,

108
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:33,072
like, such kismet, because this feels to me, like, universally,

109
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:36,852
it's like you kind of, like, didn't get the pain your boyfriend

110
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:40,342
was going through, and now that God saying, like, you're about

111
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,332
to know first hand, isn't life sick?

112
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:46,432
It's been really difficult, but my ex relates to it, and that was such a

113
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,977
blessing. Now the relationship is over, and I am so heartbroken.

114
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:53,482
You just said it shouldn't have started. What? Pick one.

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,547
He says he wants to still support me, but I don't think I'm strong

116
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,672
enough to have him in my life. It's too much. I'm worried

117
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:04,047
leaning on him will hurt too much while I'll start to get too hopeful

118
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,297
about a reconciliation of a relationship you didn't think should begin with in the first

119
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,775
place. Right. But also, it's a very isolating experience. For sure.

120
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:14,900
It is. But you can leave on your house and the rest of your family

121
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:19,032
in this time. Also, I think it's

122
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,537
a little bit of a young person, not a young person.

123
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,202
I don't know. I'm weird with family and relationships

124
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:29,557
because it always bothers me. I guess it depends on the

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,172
relationship with your family. So I have a good relationship with my family, so I

126
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:36,575
lean on my family during times like this because it's a family issue.

127
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:42,057
If you have a good relationship with your family, but instead you're choosing

128
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,827
to lean on a boyfriend who are not even that close with to me,

129
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:48,217
that's strange. Yeah. And it seems like going away a little bit, and you're taking

130
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:52,017
time away where you can be connecting with your father during this. I'm sure he's

131
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,402
freaked out too, probably more than you are, because he's the one with

132
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,552
cancer. Right, right. And obviously things can be fun. I know lots of

133
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,700
people who have parents had to have cancer. Turned out totally fine, for sure.

134
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:05,782
But he needs support of his family. And again, like Rin said,

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,782
I don't know if you have a good relationship with her or not. If it's

136
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:11,302
toxic, if it's not good, that adds a layer to it. But I think you

137
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,842
can use a hug. Your dad also, like, the good news is,

138
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,922
honestly, if you're heartbroken about this breakup, great timing,

139
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,592
because nothing takes your mind off a breakup like your dad being very

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,062
ill. Oh, my God. Honestly,

141
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:29,257
this is so crazy to say, but I mean it from the bottom of

142
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,592
my heart. Hey, girl. It was so what a relief to

143
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,597
think about and be sad over a man that I was

144
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,682
not romantically involved with. Fucking freedom.

145
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,322
Wow. It was devastating. I still cry about it to this day.

146
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:49,012
I will never be the same person, but, God damn, was it nice

147
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:52,552
for at age 35 to finally be sad over a guy

148
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:56,600
who I had not fucked. It was great.

149
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:01,152
I guess my question is just how to deal. I've never felt more alone,

150
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:04,422
and I know the relationship had to end, and knowing that helps, but it hurts

151
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,952
again. Love you guys. Love the show. Never stop what you're doing. I think you

152
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,942
just have to experience the hurts, and then it

153
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,475
won't hurt after time happens.

154
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:17,542
That's, like, exactly how this goes. And it's your first

155
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,337
relationship, so you don't know this yet, and that's okay,

156
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:25,152
but that's what happens. You mourn the relationship. You grieve

157
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,582
it, and you allow yourself to grieve it. Cry if

158
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,887
you want to cry. Spend time on the couch. Bingewise.

159
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:34,477
Don't give yourself too long because you don't want to get lost in this,

160
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:38,322
like, well of grief and never come out. That's not going to be beneficial

161
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:42,217
for you. But allow yourself to grieve this relationship. Remind yourself that

162
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:45,277
you just told us you didn't even know if you wanted it to begin in

163
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,607
the first place. So while you're grieving, also go, hey, you know

164
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,757
what, girl? This isn't the end of the world, because this guy doesn't seem like

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,452
he was your person. And that's a blessing when that relationship doesn't

166
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:58,972
end, even though it feels awful. So just give yourself time to grief and then

167
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,697
also be there for your dad. I gotta be honest. I don't think you're upset

168
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,327
about the breakup. I think you're upset that he dumped you before you dumped

169
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:10,057
him. You think? I really don't believe I

170
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,982
really don't want to believe. That's true. Based on there's, like, a little bit of

171
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,877
a bitter tone to the email, which I never use that in a negative way.

172
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,967
I love it. I condone it. Tedious. I love it.

173
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,237
People say, oh, you're better. You go, oh, because I'm a woman in the world?

174
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,977
Yes. So, yeah, I think that's

175
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:29,722
why. Because you gave all this to

176
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,187
him and it still wasn't enough. And then he says

177
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,500
this fucking gut wrenching thing to you, which is like, you don't feel like home.

178
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,042
So to me, it just really feels like you aren't a good match.

179
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,657
24 and 30 can be a

180
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,332
little rough depending on where he is emotionally, because 24 is

181
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,662
just so young and even like

182
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,247
and, you know, again, the things I learned the hard way 2022 things

183
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,417
I learned the hard way. Being emotional and being emotionally intelligent are

184
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:02,622
two different things, actually. People who are really emotional

185
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,947
in life have lower emotional intelligence than people who

186
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,172
are kind of stoic. And I read that in a book. Is that

187
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:12,852
crazy? Because people who are overly emotional don't

188
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,952
know how to censor their

189
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,477
own emotions, which is a part of being a functional person in the world.

190
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,032
I know. It is really, really interesting stuff. It is. You know,

191
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,377
actually, you gotta get a grip on yourself. Am very emotionally intelligent, but I am

192
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,857
not very emotional. And I think a lot of people will be like, a clin

193
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:32,457
doesn't have emotions. I do. I just keep them inside where they belong,

194
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:36,577
hidden. But yeah, so I

195
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,547
think that's part of it, I gotta say, like,

196
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,422
because from my breakups now in retrospect,

197
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,912
going back, the Frank one, I don't even think about that

198
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:50,302
because I was just mad that I got dumped. He wasn't a good match for

199
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,052
me. The minute he found the woman he's now married to, I knew

200
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:57,367
I said, that's the fit. I said, oh, you found her. I was kind of

201
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:00,522
excited for him. I was like, you found her. Good for you that it wasn't

202
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:04,627
me. And that sucks because I wanted to be I want everyone I want me

203
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:08,422
to be everyone's soulmate and then me to only have one soulmate. But that's just

204
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,767
a dream I have. I don't see why that's reasonable. I want

205
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,177
everyone to be in love with me for the rest of their lives and lose

206
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:18,127
sleep at night. But I only have one true person for me when I find

207
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:22,400
them all now. But I really think that

208
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:27,147
the two much harder breakups for me were James

209
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:30,847
and Dylan. The ones that I initiated. I didn't want to

210
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,357
initiate them, though. I didn't want to initiate them. You gotta do

211
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,012
what you gotta do. You want someone to come back and give you more.

212
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,967
Sometimes love isn't enough. You want someone to give you another chance.

213
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,675
You want all these things.

214
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,047
And then that's how you start to feel like, oh, wow, I'm really not special.

215
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:51,162
I'm just like a slot that's being filled and it sucks.

216
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,277
And you cry, cry, cry, and then you're like, is this how life is?

217
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:57,772
And then Kritin and Mike are like, yup. But I really do have to

218
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:01,452
say I think your dad's cancer arrived at the serendipitous

219
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:04,807
time. And it's a weird thing thing to say, but I think this is going

220
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,552
to help you reassess a lot of things in your life. And like, what does

221
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,925
a 24 year old love more than how to make her dad's cancer about her?

222
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:16,657
Yeah, this is a time to like and also there might be a part of

223
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,297
your mind that it's so painful to deal with the fact that your dad has

224
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,752
cancer that you're like, instead of focusing

225
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:26,722
on the heartbreak of the breakup, because I'll do that too. I was really

226
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:30,727
sad about one thing, and then I was like, I can't be sad about this

227
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:34,197
thing anymore, but I couldn't not be sad, so I just chose

228
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,957
another thing to be sad about, and it really did work. I don't think

229
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,392
that's a healthy response, but it works in the moment.

230
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,022
Healthy schmalthy. Well, it's toxic to be sad about something,

231
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:48,232
which I totally understand. Yeah. You want to revert the energy somewhere else because you

232
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:51,072
got the feelings in you. You got to come out somehow and just truly,

233
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:54,772
like, give yourself a lot of humor during this time.

234
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:58,332
And it felt it's so vindicating to be reading

235
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:02,322
the Buddhist book When Things Fall Apart, and they name humor

236
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,242
as one of the three most important things in life,

237
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:08,802
because did I make a joke about Aaron Carter's death?

238
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:11,467
And I kind of feel bad about it? Yes. But I also, like,

239
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:15,202
truly sad and cried over his death also. That but

240
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,627
it's like, those two things can coexist, and I think it's

241
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,462
important. I made jokes that made people

242
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,047
around me go when my dad was dying and, like, still on.

243
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,557
I love them. Like, no one gets it, you know, unless you also have a

244
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,352
similar sense of humor. But if Buddha says

245
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:36,067
I'm right, then I guess I'm just doing it right?

246
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:39,312
So kind of Pemma was like, Great job, Corn.

247
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:42,862
Now back to my Buddha reviews. Yeah. Can't argue with Buddha. Yeah,

248
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,327
there's a lot going on right now here, but I just don't think part of

249
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,407
the issue is that you love this guy and really mess them. I just don't

250
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,627
think it's true how the fuck you told us this in the email. I mean,

251
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,987
I got to be honest. I get the ick when someone

252
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,712
says they don't love me anymore. And it is wild

253
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:03,327
to me how other people don't get the ick

254
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:06,907
when that is said to them. There's no way that somebody

255
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:10,117
doesn't feel a twin when that's said to them. There's no way. I like,

256
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:13,417
one's immune to that. I lose. What do you mean? Like,

257
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,302
you're saying you get the ick when someone says they don't love you anymore.

258
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,462
That's common. No, the ick is like, I'm repulsed by their existence.

259
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,277
That's what the ick is. I see. The ick is what you call it when

260
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:26,857
you're been dating someone for six months and all of a sudden you don't like

261
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,152
the way they chew. Like a hard turn. My pussy

262
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:34,325
dries up so fast. So that's why

263
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:38,172
the Frank breakup hurt, because it was, like, in retrospect,

264
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,917
a blow to my ego and also

265
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,742
a realistic view on

266
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,297
how close you can be with someone and then how you can kind of meet

267
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:52,482
them the next day relationships,

268
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:55,492
am I right? But I was never like, man,

269
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,332
I want him back as

270
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,047
soon as he moved on to his wife. There was a little time there,

271
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,717
but as soon as I was like, oh, he's serious. Because I was like,

272
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:08,002
maybe he was just playing hard to get that. But when I

273
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,422
really moved on and found the person who he needs

274
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:14,857
to be with, I was like, oh, yeah, I'm not interested

275
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,412
in this person right at all. Right. Yeah.

276
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:22,100
IK. Ick. That's the. Ick. Got it.

277
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:26,362
Yeah. So I think those are things to and

278
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,707
I know you're very young. This is a huge thing

279
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,022
to go through. I don't know what's stage cancer. Hopefully it's treatable. But spend

280
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:36,177
a lot of time with your dad. Yeah. Never going to regret going and hanging

281
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,527
out with him about his life. I feel like a lot of us go through

282
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:42,427
our lives without knowing our parents well. So if you have a good relationship with

283
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:45,802
them, I would ask him about his childhood and make funny videos with him,

284
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,050
watch movies with him, all this stuff.

285
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:50,975
This is the time to do that,

286
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,492
guys. You can hear us in other places. Did you know that?

287
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,007
No. Well, we'll tell you about it. Actually, I did. Just kidding.

288
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:02,707
I have a patreon where I do solo episodes of

289
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,857
my solo cut podcast called The Voices in Our Heads. I put out at

290
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,582
least once one a month. And then I do group therapy over zoom.

291
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,732
And that's therapy and quotes Chad, because guess what? I'm not a licensed

292
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:16,027
therapist, but god damn, can I facilitate a group in talking about their

293
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:19,822
feelings? And it's been an incredible day in my

294
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,582
month. I really, really enjoy this. And if you want to sign up for it,

295
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:25,492
just do the five dollar a month level patreon.com.

296
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:29,602
Christinahutchinson and also I do all these fucking classes with Laurel and

297
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,342
Jackson and with shit about past lives and ghost shit. I explore all these topics.

298
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:37,357
I record those classes and I upload them onto my patreon. So there's a lot

299
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:41,077
of bang for your buck of just $5 a month. So patreon.com

300
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,797
Christine Hudsonson you won't regret it. And you

301
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,442
know where to find me if you want information on the news,

302
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:51,732
the comings and goings of world leaders

303
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,117
you're going to tune into without a country. It's on YouTube every

304
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:59,075
Saturday or anywhere you listen to podcasts. It is myself.

305
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:03,442
Mike Harrington is on the line a lot. It's a really great

306
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,207
show. And I am quiet quitting the

307
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,837
entertainment business. That being said, people love this

308
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,227
show so much. And I got so much positive feedback on it that I

309
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,452
actually was like, I'm going to keep doing it for the people. I enjoy doing

310
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,292
it too, for the people. I truly do enjoy it for herself. I truly enjoy

311
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,467
doing it. So if I could record it and then just upload

312
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:28,042
it to my room and then me and my dog could just listen to it.

313
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,512
That would be just as satisfactory to me, because it's the constant

314
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:35,157
fucking whining for a free show that I can't handle.

315
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,375
And that one's like free, free,

316
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,832
tough whining. But yeah, I appreciate all you guys

317
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,792
for listening. And it's a fun show, and especially going into the

318
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:50,467
midterm elections. And Trump is about to announce that he's running

319
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,857
again. It's supposed to be next week that he's going

320
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,522
to make that announcement. If you were bored with politics,

321
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:01,552
if you give yourself a little vacation, you need to listen again. You need

322
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,707
to listen again. And I sprinkle in some fun stuff. I sprinkle in a Taylor

323
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:08,300
Swift album review. I sprinkle in a little murder story.

324
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:12,627

336
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,632
I'm at Philanthropy Gal. And now on to the personal

337
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,200
part of the show. I just have something quick and light,

338
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:01,957
even though my heart is heavy. But for the first time,

339
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,497
I went to cheer on people for the New York City

340
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,737
Marathon. I've never done that. It's one of the best

341
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,307
fucking days of the year. I didn't realize how needed

342
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:16,042
it is for a bunch of people, especially New Yorkers, because we do everything

343
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,912
better to fucking cheer on a bunch of other

344
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:23,302
people just because they committed to a goal of running a

345
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,467
fucking marriage or going through a really bad breakup. Sure, whatever.

346
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,427
I don't give a fuck. There was no political divide. There was no no

347
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:34,027
gender divide, no racial. There was no divide. It was just

348
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,297
New Yorkers coming to cheer on. Like, some of the runners had

349
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,042
names printed on their shirts so we can go, OK,

350
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,507
Stacey. And I was just fucking clapping for people, telling them I

351
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,700
was proud of them. And it made my life so good.

352
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:50,602
There's a guy with a pineapple on his head. I saw. I saw. Yeah,

353
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:53,482
he rampized us. Okay. But also, I don't know if he did he did the

354
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,202
whole race like that. Did he do it because otherwise because

355
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,652
I was looking at his posture, I was like, that doesn't look like pineapple posture

356
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:03,417
to me. Well, there's a lot of up and down hill.

357
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:06,877
I mean, how he glued something. He had a

358
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:10,282
bald head. There's no way you can glue something as heavy as a pineapple in

359
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:14,332
your head. Was it a real pineapple? Maybe he cord it and then

360
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:18,597
it was actually either way, the idea pineapple.

361
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:21,502
You think it was a scam current. I don't even care. The fact that it

362
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,772
instilled a little bit of wonder in us and like, oh, my god, this guy

363
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:28,417
ran a whole fucking marathon with a pineapple on his head. That's so great.

364
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,942
People run in the marathon, saw in Spiderman costumes. There's people that were like,

365
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,637
obviously you have to take it seriously. It's a marathon.

366
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:39,627
It's such a worthy goal to have to set for yourself. And I'm seriously,

367
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:42,922
congratulations, everybody who ran it. People come from all over the world, and it was

368
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:46,432
so fun. Colin and I were just cheering. We made signs for people.

369
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,747
It was just planned to do this. Well, the day before,

370
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,882
he was like, oh, the marathon's happening. They go past your neighborhood, so let's do

371
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:55,402
it. Let's wake up early and do it. I'm like, yeah, I've never done it.

372
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,822
I can't believe it. He ran the marathon a couple times, and he was like

373
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,272
he's like, you will love this day just because of the

374
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:05,532
human spirit that is generated. And I'm like, oh, because I love the gay pride

375
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:09,097
parade was my favorite day of the year. Hell, yeah. It's been now second place

376
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,100
to the New York City Marathon because it is so

377
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:16,787
nutritional for your parent former ally. Christina.

378
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:23,847
It's my second favorite day. Sorry. It's my second favorite

379
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:27,132
LGBTQ residue. Because we're not celebrating someone's

380
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:30,662
sexuality. Because we're more than our fucking virtual celebrating our mental.

381
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:34,797
It's much better. We're just celebrating setting a fucking

382
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:38,602
goal for years. How long is it? Is it 36?

383
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:42,427
26. 26. But then also Dee pointed out a

384
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,102
shout out to Guerreros in her Instagram stories. She pointed out she

385
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,747
goes, I just found out there's over like $700,000

386
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,627
in prize money for the New York Marathon. Sure. She's like, I thought these people

387
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:55,987
were. Just most people are not

388
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,572
even close. To winning prize money. How many

389
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:03,507
people actually get money? Yes. So the elite runners

390
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:06,137
are doing it for fucking money because they look unprofessional.

391
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:11,452
Well, they start different. They're like, group one start now, and then ten

392
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,722
minutes later, group two. Yeah, because they can't have these idiots around them.

393
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:18,222
Yeah. I'm like, I do this for real? Yes. Fascinating.

394
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:21,812
And it was such a nice day. And it was such a nice reminder.

395
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:26,152
It feels good this year for someone running. That's it.

396
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:29,752
That's it. Life doesn't have to be so fucking complicated. We don't have to

397
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,307
relate every year. Christina, could I sell you on sports? No.

398
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:37,475
When you get into sports, it's the same thing. Basketball stuff.

399
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:42,357
But the thing is, there's so much corruption in sports. And like basketball that we're

400
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:45,277
not fucking the athletes up by giving them concussions and paying them millions of dollars

401
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,482
so they just have to fucking deal with it. And then, oh, you beat your

402
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:51,102
wife, but we'll forgive you. It's like, ugh, there's too much bullshit

403
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:53,602
with those sports. I hate to break it to you, but I'm sure rapists were

404
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,297
running yesterday for sure. But, like, for a moment in time, I didn't

405
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:00,877
wonder if they were a rape. I just wanted to clap for

406
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:04,477
them because they were fucking running. You could clap for

407
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,950
somebody because they're on the meds, which is.

408
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:12,547
I'm from fucking Philadelphia. We take sports way too seriously. If our

409
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,800
team wins, we destroy the city. Loses, we destroy the city.

410
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:19,342
I'm not really sports. And me, it's fine.

411
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,797
It's fun to cheer, for sure, but everyone

412
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,397
just gets wasted and then just fucking this was such

413
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,822
a pure day. This is such a pure oh,

414
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:35,272
my God. Yeah. Well, I think it's even amplified last year

415
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,292
when I was still living with roommates, one of my roommates ran the marathon.

416
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,022
And it's very fun, especially when you commit. Yeah. It's a huge

417
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:45,652
commitment to see them. Running by you're so proud of them. Give them water and

418
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,922
stuff. Yeah. It's wild how much it will lift your

419
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:52,447
spirits to just cheer for people you don't know. And you're like, I don't care

420
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,177
who you voted for. I don't care where you're from. I don't care how much

421
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:58,187
money you make. You're running. Go. Sarah.

422
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm having a hard time, guys,

423
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:06,337
more than the marathon. But I'm trying not to wallow in it.

424
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,487
And I'm trying to look at the positive shit. And that's something that's positive.

425
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:14,622
Well, congratulations to anyone who ran in the marathon.

426
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:17,872
And congratulations to me because it was the first time when I didn't book

427
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:21,727
something on the Upper West Side. The day of the marathon. Paul and

428
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:24,562
I Paula and I have a gun hanging every time.

429
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,832
Fucking streak of making plans on the day of the

430
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:31,327
marathon. Right? Directly in the marathon, we will go

431
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:35,122
to Alice's Tea Cup every single time. And I

432
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:39,022
actually, Jacob's Pickles heard someone fucking talking on

433
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,677
Saturday. And I was like, don't make plans with Paula on Sunday. And it was

434
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:45,127
so funny. Paula had actually just texted me, make plans to make

435
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:48,067
plans. Holy shit. And I was like, what is it about us?

436
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:52,147
Energy marathons in the stars. Crazy. And I saw

437
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,957
her not that long ago. Anyway, all right, so are you

438
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:59,302
mine is not about the marathon. It is about well,

439
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,947
I have another marathon, marathon of life that women have to run.

440
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,947
The marathon of life. Yes. That we don't train for.

441
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,892
We just get thrown into it. Well, so I was just thinking and this is

442
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,222
based on events on the weekend, but like, this is something I had

443
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,662
put some thought into prior.

444
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:19,927
And it's about the currency of having a

445
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,052
boyfriend and. The value that we place on it in society.

446
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:26,675
Because I got to be honest,

447
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:31,550
when women get a boyfriend, and I am guilty of this too,

448
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:36,350
not necessarily, they act like they're better than you.

449
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,075
Society treats them with a higher value.

450
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:44,992
And it's interesting because I feel

451
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,672
this too. And that's, to me, one of the only perks

452
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:52,072
of having a boyfriend is like it's like, to me, it's like going out with

453
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:55,542
makeup on, like you feel treated better by society.

454
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:59,287
But I think this is really not true

455
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:03,472
and something that we have been convinced about and convinced ourselves about, because for me,

456
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:07,752
as an outsider looking in, I've never seen an accomplished

457
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:10,942
woman get a boyfriend and thought to myself,

458
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,437
wow, her appraised value just went up.

459
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,202
Never once have I thought that. But I

460
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,997
know when I have a boyfriend, there is something in my head better

461
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,492
than you that says, I know other people on top of right now.

462
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,827
Sorry, you're single bit. Yeah, sorry, you're sad bitch.

463
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:32,587
And it's a weird thing to think, because I certainly from being

464
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,472
me, I don't feel in my home that my value has gone

465
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:40,712
up. Oftentimes I feel like my value goes down because I'm not as productive,

466
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm not trying as hard to look good because

467
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,450
I already tricked someone. Right.

468
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,500
I still try very hard and, like, a problem.

469
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:56,975
You didn't try hard. Like, you're five. Oh, right.

470
00:27:57,337 --> 00:28:00,652
Too early. And so I don't give up,

471
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,727
like, two months. And I'm not that bold. I'm not

472
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:04,562
that bold.

473
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:13,732
I feel like me and most women,

474
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:17,757
when we have a boyfriend, we strut around like we're

475
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:21,222
wearing our final slinns, when in reality, it's the Emperor's

476
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,847
New Clothes. This bitch. I'm like looking at these women. I'll go,

477
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,632
you're pleased out, bitch. No, you look stupid

478
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:32,137
and it drives you crazy. Or, like, a more modern example

479
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,082
would be like, you ever see that video of Lord when she thinks she's,

480
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:38,947
like, dancing? Really good thing,

481
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:42,847
really bad. Yeah. I got to find that moment really a

482
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,987
choreographer so much more of a contribution to society when

483
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,172
a conversation has a boyfriend and is like, peacocking him.

484
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,652
You look like Lord dancing when she thought she

485
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,362
could dance. And we were all like, Holy shit, this bitch can't dance.

486
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,717
And it's embarrassing because Lord is one of the most talented vocalists and

487
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:05,412
songwriters living. But I really do I love Lord,

488
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:09,502
but, like, she's such a no bad dancer. When you say peacocking your

489
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,477
boyfriend, do you mean, like, on social media everywhere?

490
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:16,072
She's not showing up all the time. Being with

491
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,672
them, people are like, tableau functions. There's an

492
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:23,427
excited way that girlfriends will be around their boyfriend, and it's

493
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:27,382
like, only you're excited about him because he's bringing down your value,

494
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,897
everyone. And so I was in a place where that was happening this weekend,

495
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:34,357
and it was, like, hilarious to me.

496
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:35,075
Wow.

497
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:40,487
I was like, Am I in some kind of an alternate universe.

498
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:45,652
And I don't know, because I certainly understand the feeling. I try

499
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,352
not to do it in public, but I mean, on social media every now and

500
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,750
once and again, I'll do it constantly content.

501
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:54,472
But there is something where you do feel like,

502
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:58,012
oh, other people are going to notice me more,

503
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:01,372
or be like, wow. To seem as, like, posting a lot

504
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:04,852
about a TV show you're on or posting about how

505
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,987
much money makes, it's very, to me, very similar.

506
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,377
But it kind of only works with

507
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:14,482
straight women. I think it works in the lesbian community. So I'm just saying I

508
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:18,022
can't speak for them. It doesn't work for men, though. That's why

509
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:21,877
men keep the fact that they have a girlfriend away from the

510
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:25,357
world for as long as I think possible. So that bitches still dm'em on

511
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,702
Instagram party game I invented for myself. How do you do that? Was looking

512
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:32,892
back and forth at couples Instagrams and counting how many squares

513
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:36,772
the woman has dedicated to the guy on her main feed and how many

514
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,650
squares the man has dedicated to her.

515
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:43,702
But see, significant. Let's make a new role of song. Just don't post a buy

516
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,500
relationship on your Instagram. Crazy.

517
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:50,527
And taking it to even, like, the next level. The amount of times I've seen

518
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,127
a chick walking around with a guy I dumped and the look in

519
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:57,962
her face when she sees me, it was like I made a mistake.

520
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:02,227
I accidentally sold a treasure at a garage sale, and now she's about

521
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,497
to make millions on Antiques Roadshow. This look,

522
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,752
and I've seen it many, and they're giving me the evil eye because

523
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,842
they think I want this guy back. Vintage shoehorn. And I'm like,

524
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,372
Girl, I already bit him like this to see if he was gold.

525
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:18,637
And the gold plating came off on my teeth. Wow. Come on.

526
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:22,357
It's scrap metal. Like, you got a scrap metal boo. And then I

527
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,177
was also thinking about and I was like and I was like,

528
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,122
even a step further. The most notable thing about all

529
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:33,262
my exboyfriends, with the exception of two, was that they dated me.

530
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:37,147
Yeah, you're going to do that and then moving forward. I think the

531
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,597
most notable thing about some of you ladies is that

532
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,897
you fucked someone who dated me. Uh, if that's not going to keep

533
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,572
you up at night, haunt your dreams forever,

534
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:50,242
I don't know what is. That's it. I'm sad. I am me.

535
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,562
No one likes me, but I am me. And that's sad.

536
00:31:55,387 --> 00:31:58,567
What a crazy, meaningless existence we have.

537
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:02,587
Just like, boyfriend is not currently. We get people

538
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,772
get really caught up in the comparing of all kinds,

539
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,802
comparing bodies, comparing relationships, comparing income status,

540
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:12,097
comparing careers, comparing everything. And I think we just need a

541
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,952
friendly reminder to take a step back and reach down in our

542
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:19,167
own Honey Pots and make our lives magical

543
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:23,152
and wonderful. But you have to boldly pursue that it's addicting to

544
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:26,992
compare yourself, and it's detrimental to your soul. Well,

545
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,272
beyond comparing, too. It's just like it's truly like this heterosexual

546
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:34,325
female notion that man equals currency. Right,

547
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:38,772
but that's why women tend to be so desperate to share the boyfriend

548
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:42,532
saying, because it's like, oh, you think that is way more value than it does.

549
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:45,052
I mean, there are times when it does. I mean, I think we see it

550
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,462
more in celebrities like Power Cups, david Beckham

551
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:52,452
and Victoria Beckham. Yes. That added value to both of their situations,

552
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:56,152
for sure. But I mean, that's how amazing you have

553
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,257
to get. That's how amazing you have to get. You have to be one of

554
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,982
the number one footballers in the world and one of the most famous pop stars

555
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:06,367
of all time with her own clothing and makeup brand. Like, that's what we're talking

556
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:09,202
about. And, like, when you say it's a call out, it kind of is,

557
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,547
but it can't be because this is

558
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,025
not even based on this has happened multiple times now.

559
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:20,212
Experience. Yes. The same exact scenario. So at this time, it's like,

560
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:24,082
this is not unique. This is a pattern that has been created or

561
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,927
that I am recognizing. And it's

562
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:31,177
sad. I had never heard a ton of people talk about it

563
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:34,702
before, but Clementine Ford talks about it a lot. She's this

564
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,502
wonderful Australian feminist who I'm absolutely obsessed with. Speaking of muff

565
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:45,082
diving, I'd love to, but she

566
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:48,892
just will go on these rants in her Instagram story, and everyone

567
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,925
is fucking feminist poetry. It's so good. Wow.

568
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:57,712
She added to my favorite. I just wish and people

569
00:33:57,775 --> 00:34:00,875
have very polarizing opinions on her, but of course you do, because she's awesome.

570
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:04,867
If she was not awesome, people will be like, she's great, but she's awesome.

571
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:08,157
So people like, what a bitch. It's like, yeah, a bitch

572
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,832
with a lot of money, a lot of followers. She's wrote a lot of,

573
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:13,222
like, best selling books. But she's just yeah,

574
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:17,737
she was talking about it, and I was like, this is you really? And she

575
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,207
has a child that she made with a man, I'm guessing

576
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:25,250
probably. Somewhere along the line. Yeah.

577
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:29,092
And it's also part of it is like, I'm saying it out loud because I

578
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,557
also don't even know how to fully undo it within myself.

579
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,052
Because we always want to be of the utmost value. We want to be doing

580
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,975
all the best things, achieving all the things. And it's like,

581
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:43,632
how do we like knowing how we exist

582
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:47,472
on our own? Seeing the stats, seeing the statistics

583
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:50,827
about happiness, about finances, about success

584
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,587
levels that women experience when they fly solo.

585
00:34:56,212 --> 00:35:00,012
But then how do we undo that need for this currency

586
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:03,607
that is voiced? It's the currency part, because I

587
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,952
think love is so it's a necessary part of

588
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,947
life is fucking lonely,

589
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:14,212
and it sucked most of the time, for sure. And I got to be honest,

590
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,752
it's nice to have someone by your side. Yes.

591
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,007
Until it turns into but that's also not

592
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,382
this conversation is about it's not like that love isn't good. Right. It's the

593
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:27,717
currency. It's about how other people perceive

594
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:31,032
you when you have a boyfriend, as if you have more value. Right. So it's

595
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:34,512
not about is your life periodically better or worse?

596
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:38,122
Right. Of course, sometimes it's not something I don't believe in love or, like,

597
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:41,677
relationship. No, not at all. It's just so funny that you bring this up because

598
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,682
from the male perspective, it is so different. Like,

599
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:48,982
not having a girlfriend as a man. I think when

600
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:52,312
you have a boyfriend, your boys would give you like, this bitch got. Yeah,

601
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,787
kind of. When I see my friends in relationships,

602
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:59,427
most of my close friends are in really good, happy relationships.

603
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,902
I'm happy for them in that regard, but there is a part of me that

604
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,277
is just like, man, oh, man, this is such a different life,

605
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,592
and I'm glad I'm not doing it right. Like, the relationship life.

606
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:13,177
Yeah, well, that'll downlife both,

607
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,702
I think. Because I think what I get from my friends that are

608
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,272
in relationships, some of them, the ones that are a little more mature, that have

609
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,107
kids and stuff like that, they look at me as they're just like,

610
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:28,927
oh, it'll happen for you. Somewhere you

611
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:32,377
got freedom. Yeah. What that's priceless? So it

612
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:36,200
is weird to me that they look at women

613
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:41,277
that don't have boyfriends as like lesser

614
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:45,052
than some sort. Of this is kind of like a

615
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,582
continuation of the piece that I wrote for I guess it was. Glamour magazine

616
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:52,047
when I was 30 and started dating James, and everyone fucking congratulated

617
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:55,522
me like I had just won the goddamn Nobel Prize, right? Anyone who knows him

618
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:58,927
knows he was not we had so many conversations about this topic on the

619
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:02,752
podcast, and it does like, somebody, a colleague was engaged. Like, I found

620
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,627
out she was engaged the other day at the comedy club. But I was.

621
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,850
I said congratulations. And then as I said it, I was like,

622
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:11,975
what am I really congratulating her for? I just want I don't know.

623
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:15,997
I love when people find love and she's great. Yes. But I'm like,

624
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,372
oh, God, I wanted to be mindful that I'm not I still

625
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,857
say things like, congratulations whenever people have a baby on purpose

626
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:27,147
or get married. You're still like a human existing

627
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:30,717
in a society with certain structures.

628
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:33,200
And yes, it is exciting. And I think yeah,

629
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:38,382
it still deserves and I think it doesn't deserve a congratulations when someone gets engaged,

630
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:42,997
but it definitely does. But they

631
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,032
didn't make value go up. Right. And the energy that you're talking about, there's,

632
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,332
like a desperation, and it's coming from a place of bullshit.

633
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:53,242
It's coming from a place that's fake. And it's also

634
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,077
like, you know, I think it's like, okay, so we're all,

635
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,752
like, say every little thing in life has a

636
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,932
piece of value and, like, we're going up to try and make a hundred or

637
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:07,025
whatever. So it's like, yes, I think there maybe is some low value

638
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:10,752
in having a partner from the outside perspective.

639
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:14,197
But it's like, wouldn't she rather be,

640
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,427
like, blondie? She never got married.

641
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:21,532
But would I rather be unmarried blondie or would I rather be

642
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,312
a married lady blondie?

643
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:27,877
Blondie like Debbie Harry? Yes. Or is

644
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:31,317
she married? Or would you rather be like Victoria Beckham?

645
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:34,902
I think well, that's different. I mean, Victoria Beckham,

646
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:38,997
that's like fourleaf

647
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:42,007
clover. That's why we talk about it so much,

648
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:46,552
because it's like, how many actual people can you name who

649
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,927
are both equally powerful, equally good looking,

650
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:53,825
still love each other after all the time, raise their family by themselves

651
00:38:54,187 --> 00:38:56,837
and didn't have, like, higher nannies and shit?

652
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:00,907
She had nannies. No, she's not as primary caretaker. That was,

653
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,297
like, a big thing for her. Wow. Yeah, that was, like, a big part.

654
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm pretty sure Debbie Harry on that list of people.

655
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:11,107
There's, like, a list of women who have never got married and

656
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:14,527
are like and it's like when you look at the list, you're like, this is

657
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:18,372
like everyone on this list is a fucking banger. Yeah. Just an incredible

658
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:21,627
list of people, right? I knew she was involved with one of the guitar players

659
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,952
from no, Not Married. It's not that these people don't have

660
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,372
relationships. It's not that they don't believe in love. It's not that they never even

661
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:32,277
cohabitated none of putting all your eggs in the relationship basket

662
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:35,087
is just valued by society. But it's stupid.

663
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:39,477
It's so funny to see. It's really funny

664
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:43,267
to see, especially someone with

665
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:46,147
someone else that you used to date.

666
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,092
You launching it in your face, like, I didn't already live

667
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,797
that life. I don't actually know what's really going

668
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,832
on behind the scenes when someone brags to you about

669
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,227
something that you don't give a fuck about. That's one of the funniest

670
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:04,025
scenarios that life has a fuck. It's just like,

671
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,522
I know the truth, right? But they think they have

672
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:13,372
all this value and you're like, no, you don't. What the

673
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:16,792
vision of somebody in front of you going, ha ha. Karin. And you're like,

674
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,302
Sit on it. I don't give a fuck. Like, your problem now, bitch. Well,

675
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,242
and the funniest thing is, all the people who have experienced with, like, the man

676
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:27,127
in every single instance, his life got significantly worse when

677
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:30,732
I broke up with him. So it's like, you're flying

678
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:34,717
a lower value item than I once had in my face.

679
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,467
Right? It's like, you should go ahead and have them. You live in a van,

680
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:41,242
you shit. On a diamond ring. And then you're just like, don't you

681
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,722
wish you had this diamond ring? I'm like, It smells like poop. Can you leave?

682
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,050
Get your poop ring out of my home. Get your poop ring out of here.

683
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:53,182
We're joking and stuff. But it really did leave me kind of, like,

684
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:56,397
left a real sadness in my heart, because as much as I love to troll

685
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:57,212
bitches,

686
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:04,552
I want every woman, every woman, even women

687
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:08,737
I don't particularly like or respect, to want better

688
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,950
shit for themselves.

689
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:15,667
What are you doing? That's our Christmas wish. What are you doing?

690
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:18,425
Oh, God. Every goddamn time.

691
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:23,012
So should you take next year off to cheer for people of the marathon

692
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:29,122
yesterday to clean my apartment since I was Alfred? That's nice.

693
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:32,397
It's salad. That's great. Which I know sounds sad, but I fucking love salad.

694
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:35,922
I, like, literally, like, green salads, dog time salads. That's fucking

695
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:39,275
that sounds wonderful. I love the crunch of the iceberg lettuce. Okay,

696
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:43,797
guys, our guest, we love the crunch of his comedy and his presence

697
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:47,452
on our show. Look out for his one man show coming up called

698
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,307
my dad isn't Danny DeVito. You can also watch his YouTube stand up

699
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,927
comedy special for free called Brain Noise. Ladies and gentlemen,

700
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:58,037
please welcome to the show Anthony DeVito.

701
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:04,372
And then I'll just use so we don't have another interest, but we'll just

702
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:07,597
do. The only thing we'll need is this last email. Okay?

703
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,800
Do you want to do the ads now, or do you want to wait?

704
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,402
Can we wait? Yeah, because I always fuck up my rhythm a little bit.

705
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,325
I just have to pee really quick.
